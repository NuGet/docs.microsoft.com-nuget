# docs.microsoft.com-nuget

The NuGet documentation is now hosted on docs.microsoft.com/nuget. This repository was migrated from the former NuGetDocs repository, https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetDocs.

Contributors should note the following:

- All markdown files are in the docs folder and various subfolders.
- Tables now use markdown instead of inline HTML.
- Other instances of inline HTML, such as callouts, also use markdown format now. The exception is &lt; and &gt; which use the inline HTML codes `&lt;` and `&gt;`.
- Images are better organized into media folders within each subfolder.
