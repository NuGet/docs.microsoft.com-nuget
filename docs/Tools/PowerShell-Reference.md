## Add-BindingRedirect

Examines all assemblies within the output path for a project and adds binding redirects to the appropriate configuration files. For additional details on what this means, see [Redirecting Assembly Versions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/7wd6ex19.aspx) on MSDN.

> [!NOTE]
> NuGet 1.2+ automatically runs this command when installing a package.

### Usage

    Add-BindingRedirect [-ProjectName <string>]


### Parameters

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
ProjectName | Specifies the project to which to add binding redirects, defaulting to the default project. The -ProjectName switch itself is optional.

### Examples

    Add-BindingRedirect MyProjectName


## Find-Package

*Version 3.0+*

Searches a package source using a package ID or keywords.

### Usage

        Find-Package [<keywords>] [-Source <string>] [-First <int>] [-Skip <int>] [-AllVersions] [-IncludePrerelease] [-ExactMatch]

### Parameters

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
&lt;keywords&gt; | Searches the package source for packages with the keywords. Use the `-ExactMatch` switch to return only those packages whose package ID matches the keywords. If no keywords are given, Find-Package returns a list of the top 20 packages by downloads.
Source | Specifies the URL or path for the package source to search. If omitted, searched the currently selected package source.
First | Specifies the number of packages to return from the beginning of the list. If not specified, Find-Package lists 20 packages.
Skip | Skips the specified number of packages, counting from the beginning of the list
AllVersions | Displays all available versions of each package instead of only the latest version.
IncludePrerelease | Indicates whether to include prerelease packages in the list.

### Examples

    # List packages with the keyword Elmah available
    Find-Package Elmah

    # List all versions of the jquery package
    Find-Package jquery -AllVersions -ExactMatch

    # List packages with the keyword EntityFramework and version 6.1.1
    Find-Package EntityFramework -version 6.1.1


## Get-Package

Retrieves the list of packages installed in the local repository, or lists packages available from a package source when used with the `-ListAvailable` switch.

### Usage

    Get-Package [-Source <string>] [-ListAvailable] [-Updates] [-ProjectName <string>] [-Filter <string>] [-First <int>] [-Skip <int>] [-AllVersions] [-IncludePrerelease] [-PageSize <int>]

With no parameters, `Get-Package` displays the list of packages installed in the default project.

### Parameters

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
Source | Specifies the URL or path of a package source. When used with -ListAvailable, defaults to nuget.org.
ListAvailable | Lists packages available from a package source, defaulting to nuget.org. If -PageSize and/or -First are not specified, this will show 50 packages.
Updates | Lists packages that have an update available from the package source.
ProjectName | Specifies the project from which to get installed packages.
Filter | Specifies a filter string used to narrow down the list of packages returned. The filter is searched for in the package ID, the description and tags.
IncludePrerelease | Indicates that prerelease packages should be included in the list.
First | Specifies the number of packages to return from the beginning of the list. If not specified, defaults to 50.
Skip | Skips the specified number of packages, counting from the beginning of the list.
AllVersions | Displays all available versions of each package instead of only the latest version.
PageSize | *(3.0+)* When used with -ListAvailable, specifies the number of packages to list before giving a prompt to continue. The command will continue listing packages as long as there are more to return. Without -PageSize, at most 50 packages are listed by default.

### Examples

    # Lists the packages installed in the current solution
    Get-Package

    # Lists packages available in the current package source
    Get-Package -ListAvailable

### Examples

    # Updates all packages in every project.
    Update-Package

    # Updates every package in the MvcApplication1 project
    Update-Package -Project MvcApplication1

    # Updates the Elmah package in every project to the latest version
    Update-Package Elmah

    # Updates the Elmah package to version 1.1.0 in every project.
