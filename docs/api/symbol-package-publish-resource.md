# Push Symbol Packages

It is possible to push symbols packages ([snupkg](../create-packages/Symbol-Packages-snupkg.md)) using the NuGet V3 API.
These operations are based off of the `SymbolPackagePublish` resource found in the [service index](service-index.md).

## Versioning

The following `@type` value is used:

@type value                 | Notes
--------------------        | -----
SymbolPackagePublish/4.9.0  | The initial release

## Base URL

The base URL for the following APIs is the value of the `@id` property of the `SymbolPackagePublish/4.9.0` resource in the
package source's [service index](service-index.md). For the documentation below, nuget.org's URL is used. Consider 
`https://www.nuget.org/api/v2/symbolpackage` as a placeholder for the `@id` value found in the service index.

## HTTP methods

The `PUT` HTTP method is supported by this resource. 

## Push a symbol package

nuget.org supports pushing new symbol packages format ([snupkg](../create-packages/Symbol-Packages-snupkg.md)) using the following API. 

```
PUT https://www.nuget.org/api/v2/symbolpackage
```

Symbol packages with the same ID and version
can be submitted multiple times. A symbol package will be rejected in the following cases.
- A package with the same ID and version does not exist.
- A symbol package with the same ID and version was pushed but is not yet published.
- The symbol package ([snupkg](../create-packages/Symbol-Packages-snupkg.md)) is invalid (see [symbol package constraints](../create-packages/Symbol-Packages-snupkg.md)).

### Request parameters

Name           | In     | Type   | Required | Notes
-------------- | ------ | ------ | -------- | -----
X-NuGet-ApiKey | Header | string | yes      | For example, `X-NuGet-ApiKey: {USER_API_KEY}`

The API key is an opaque string gotten from the package source by the user and configured into the client. No
particular string format is mandated but the length of the API key should not exceed a reasonable size for HTTP header
values.

### Request body

The request body for the symbol push is same as with the request body of a package push request (see [package push and delete](package-publish-resource.md)). 

### Response

Status Code | Meaning

401         | The user is not authorized to perform this action.
