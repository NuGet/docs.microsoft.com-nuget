> Alternative solution: Use NuGetSolver, our automated experimental tool from Microsoft DevLabs(not officially supported by NuGet) for solving dependency conflicts, to help you find solutions to problems like this automatically!
If you're using Visual Studio 2022, and have nuget.org as your only source, [NuGetSolver](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/nuget/introducing-nugetsolver-a-powerful-tool-for-resolving-nuget-dependency-conflicts-in-visual-studio/) can help free your dependency graph of resolver warnings/errors.
[Learn more about how you can try out NuGetSolver](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/nuget/introducing-nugetsolver-a-powerful-tool-for-resolving-nuget-dependency-conflicts-in-visual-studio/#usage-recommendations-and-known-constraints) and we'd love to hear your feedback about your experience.
