  - name: License terms
    questions:
      - question: What are the default license terms if a package doesn't provide specific license information?
        answer: |
          Each package is governed by the terms that are included with the package. You should review the applicable terms before accessing, downloading, or acquiring any packages. On NuGet.org, use the **License Info** link on the package page.
          
          If a package does not specify the licensing terms, contact the package owner directly using the **Contact owners** link on the NuGet.org package page. Microsoft does not license any intellectual property to you from third party package providers and is not responsible for information provided by third parties.

    questions:
      - question: Can I edit package metadata after it's been uploaded?
        answer: |
          NuGet recommends all packages to be signed. A design principle of package signing is that signed package content must be immutable, which includes the nuspec. Editing the package metadata results in changes to the nuspec, invalidating existing signatures. We recommend modifying existing workflows to not require editing the package metadata after the package has been created.
          
          Note that dependencies listed for your package are generated automatically from the package itself and cannot be edited.
          
          In addition, uploading packages to [int.nugettest.org](https://int.nugettest.org) is a great way to test and validate your package without making a package available in the public gallery. API Endpoint: https://apiint.nugettest.org/v3/index.json
          
      - question: Can I delete a package published to NuGet.org?
        answer: |
          In general, we do not support deleting a package published to NuGet.org. Read more about our [policy on deleting packages](policies/deleting-packages.md).
          
      - question: Is it possible to reserve names for packages that will be published in future?
        answer: |
          Yes. You can reserve IDs for packages on [NuGet.org](https://www.nuget.org/) by requesting a package ID prefix for your account. In order to request a package ID prefix, follow the instructions in the [documentation](id-prefix-reservation.md).
          
      - question: How do I claim ownership for packages ?
        answer: |
          See [Managing package owners on NuGet.org](../nuget-org/publish-a-package.md#managing-package-owners-on-nugetorg).
          
      - question: How do I deal with a package owner who is violating my software license?
        answer: |
          We encourage the NuGet community to work together to resolve any disputes that may arise between package owners and the owners of other software. We have crafted a [dispute resolution process](policies/dispute-resolution.md) to follow before asking NuGet.org administrators to intercede.
          
      - question: Is it recommended to upload my test packages to NuGet.org?
        answer: |
          For test purposes, you can use [int.nugettest.org](https://int.nugettest.org), or alternative public NuGet servers like [myget.org](https://myget.org) or [Azure DevOps](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudioalm/2015/08/27/announcing-package-management-support-for-vsotfs/).
          
          Note that packages uploaded to int.nugettest.org may not be preserved.
          
      - question: What is the maximum size of packages I can upload to NuGet.org?
        answer: |
          NuGet.org allows packages up to 250MB, but we recommend keeping packages under 1MB if possible and using dependencies to link packages together. As a rule of thumb, packages contain only one assembly to avoid collisions.
          
          NuGet uses HTTP to download packages, so larger packages have a higher likelihood of failed installs than smaller ones.
          
          It is possible to share dependencies between multiple packages, making the total download size for consumers of your NuGet packages smaller.
          
          Dependencies are mostly static and never change. When fixing a bug in code, the dependencies may not need to be updated. If you bundle dependencies, you end up reshipping larger packages every time. By splitting NuGet packages into related dependencies, upgrades are much more fine-grained for consumers of your package.

    questions:
      - question: Why can't I download packages from or upload packages to NuGet.org?
        answer: |
          First, make sure you're using the latest versions of NuGet. If that version continues to fail, [contact support](https://www.nuget.org/policies/Contact) and provide additional connection troubleshooting information including:
          
          - The version of NuGet you're using
          - The package sources you're using
          - A restore log with detailed verbosity
          - MTR or a Fiddler traces (see below)
          - Your geographical area
          - Whether your machine is behind a proxy or firewall?
          - Is your machine located on a cloud providers' data center (Azure, AWS etc)? If yes, please provide the name of the provider and the region.
          
          *To capture MTR:*
          
          - Download [WinMTR](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winmtr/files/WinMTR-v092.zip/download).
          - Enter `api.nuget.org` as the hostname and click **Start**.
          - Wait until the **Sent** column is >= 100.
          
              ![Capturing MTR](media/mtr.png)
          
          - Copy text to clipboard.
          
          *To capture Fiddler:*
          
          - Install the latest version of [Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/download/fiddler).
          - Start Fiddler and disable capturing traffic using the **File > Capture Traffic** menu.
          - Remove all sessions (select all items in the list, press the **Delete** key).
          - Configure Fiddler to capture HTTPS traffic by checking **Decrypt HTTPS traffic** in the **HTTPS** tab of the **Tools > Fiddler Options...** menu.
          - Close Visual Studio.
          - Enable the **File > Capture Traffic** menu.
          - Start Visual Studio or nuget.exe .exe and perform the actions that are not working. The traffic generated by these actions should show up in Fiddler.
          - Once the actions have run, use **File > Save > All Sessions** to store the captured sessions.
          
          Note: it may be required to set the `HTTP_PROXY` environment variable to `http://127.0.0.1:8888` for routing NuGet traffic through Fiddler.
          
          If that fails, try the [tips mentioned in this StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21049908/using-fiddler-to-sniff-visual-studio-2013-requests-proxy-firewall).

    questions:
      - question: How to recover NuGet.org password login?
        answer: |
          Please note that the [NuGet.org Password login has been discontinued](https://blog.nuget.org/20180515/NuGet.org-will-only-support-MSA-AAD-starting-June.html). Unfortunately, NuGet.org has no way to recover password accounts, you can only log in to NuGet.org with a personal Microsoft account (MSA) or Azure Active Directory (AAD) account. 
          
          If you want to transfer the ownership of your packages from your previous account, please follow our [dispute resolution process](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/nuget-org/policies/dispute-resolution).

          If you are unable to use Microsoft login, [please follow the steps to recover your NuGet.org account](#unable-to-use-microsoft-login--how-do-i-recover-my-nuget-org-account)
      
      - question: Which Microsoft account is linked to my NuGet.org account?
        answer: |
          If you have forgotten which Microsoft account is associated with your NuGet.org account, please follow the steps below to get assistance.
          1. Go to [NuGet.org login page](https://www.nuget.org/users/account/LogOn) and click on **Need assistance signing in?** link.
          1. This will show you the pop-up dialog box for assistance. Follow the steps in this dialog box to understand the associated Microsoft account(s) for your NuGet.org account.
          
      - question: How to change the Microsoft account I use for NuGet.org login?
        answer: |
          If you wish to change the Microsoft account for NuGet.org user, follow the steps below. Lets say your Microsoft account with email `account1@outlook.com` is associated with your NuGet.org account with username `MyNuGetAccount`. You wish to change the login to another Microsoft account with email `account2@outlook.com`
          1. Please sign in using **currently associated Microsoft account** i.e. `account1@outlook.com` on the [login page](https://www.nuget.org/users/account/LogOn) after clicking **Sign in with Microsoft**.
          1. Once logged in, go to your [account settings](https://www.nuget.org/account) page.
          1. Expand the section for **Login Account**. Click on the **Change Account** button.
          1. You will now be redirected to the microsoft login page. Please sign in with the account that you wish to change the association to i.e. `account2@outlook.com`. **Note**: you might need to click on **Sign out and sign in with different account** during the sign in flow to be able to login with a different Microsoft account.
          1. If you see an error like below, see [Microsoft account is linked with another NuGet.org account](#microsoft-account-is-linked-with-another-nuget-org-account) for more details.
              >_Failed to update the Microsoft account with 'account2 <account2@outlook.com>'. This could happen if it is already linked to another NuGet account. Contact support for more information._
          
          1. Once you have successfully signed in with your second account, you will be redirected back to your NuGet.org account settings page and you should now see the new Microsoft account associated as the login account. Going forward you should use this account when signing into NuGet.org.
          
      - question: Microsoft account is linked with another NuGet.org account.
        answer: |
          If you tried changing your Microsoft login and saw the error below:
          > _Failed to update the Microsoft account with 'account2 <account2@outlook.com>'. This could happen if it is already linked to another NuGet account. Contact support for more information._
          
          Lets say you were trying to change Microsoft account login from `account1@outlook.com` for NuGet.org user with username `MyNuGetAccount1` to another Microsoft account with email `account2@outlook.com`. And you see the error above.
          
          **What does the error above mean?
          
          It means that there is another NuGet.org account which is associated with the Microsoft account that you are trying to change it to i.e. in above example the Microsoft account with email `<account2@outlook.com>` is associated with another NuGet.org account with, say, username `MyNuGetAccount2`.
          
          You cannot change the associated login with a Microsoft account that is linked to a different NuGet.org account.
          
      - question: I forgot I had another NuGet.org account, how do I find out which NuGet.org account it is?
        answer: |
          Login with the second Microsoft account on the [login page](https://www.nuget.org/users/account/LogOn?returnUrl=%2F# "login page"). This will log you into the NuGet.org account that is currently associated with the second Microsoft account. You can then view the uploaded packages and perform account management on this account.
          
      - question: I do not care about this second NuGet.org account, I want to change my login for first NuGet.org account with the second Microsoft account. What do I do?
        answer: |
          If you wish to not care about the second NuGet.org account and still want to re-use the associated Microsoft account with email `account2@outlook.com`. 
          
          You can release the association between the Microsoft account and NuGet.org account by deleting the NuGet.org account.
          1. Follow the steps to [delete user](#how-to-delete-my-nuget-org-account) for the second NuGet.org account `MyNuGetAccount2`. 
          1. Once this account is deleted, you can retry the steps to [change Microsoft account login](#how-to-change-the-microsoft-account-i-use-for-nuget-org-login).
          
      - question: Wait, I care about this second account too. I do not want to lose this account but change my associated account logins for first account.
        answer: |
          You will need to create/use a third Microsoft account, say, with email `account3@outlook.com`. 
          1. First you should login with your second Microsoft account, `account2@outlook.com` on NuGet.org. Follow the steps above to change associated logins and associate the third Microsoft account with this NuGet.org account.
          1. Once done, your second Microsoft account with email `account2@outlook.com` is free to be associated to your first NuGet.org account, `MyNuGetAccount1`. Follow the same steps above to change microsoft logins to the second Microsoft account.
          
      - question: Signing in with Microsoft account shows me my email is linked to another Microsoft account
        answer: |
          If you tried to sign in with your Microsoft account, say, with email `account1@outlook.com` and you see an error like below:
          > _The account with email 'account1@outlook.com' is linked with another microsoft account._
          >
          > _If you would like to update the linked Microsoft account you can do so from the account settings page._
          
      - question: What does the error above mean?
        answer: |
          When an account is created on NuGet.org, there is a communication email address associated with that account. This is usually same as the email address that is used for associated Microsoft account. However, you could choose to specify a different email address for communication. So, technically, you could have a different Microsoft account, say with `account2@outlook.com` that is linked to NuGet.org account with communication email address as `account1@outlook.com`.
          
          So the error above means that there already exists NuGet.org account with communication email address `account1@outlook.com` but is associated with another Microsoft account with email **that is not** `account1@outlook.com`.
          
      - question: How do I find which Microsoft account is linked to this NuGet.org account?
        answer: |
          You should use the [sign in assistance](#which-microsoft-account-is-linked-to-my-nuget-org-account) flow to figure out which Microsoft account is linked to the NuGet.org account with the email address `account1@outlook.com`.

      - question: Unable to use Microsoft login, how do I recover my NuGet.org account?
        answer: |
          If you tried using the [sign in assistance](#which-microsoft-account-is-linked-to-my-nuget-org-account) and you do not have access to the Microsoft account that is associated with your NuGet.org account, please contact your Microsoft account support:
          
          - Microsoft Account (MSA): [Get help with your Microsoft account](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/get-help-with-your-microsoft-account-ace6f3b3-e2d3-aeb1-6b96-d2e9e7e52133)
          - Work or school account (AAD): [Work or school account help](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/work-or-school-account-help-718b3d92-a8a7-4656-8a05-c0228d346b7d) or contact your admin tenant.

      - question: How to transform my NuGet.org account to an organization?
        answer: |
          If you want to transform your account to an organization, please follow the steps given in the documentation for [organizations on nuget.org](organizations-on-nuget-org.md).
          
      - question: NuGet.org login issues for AAD accounts with unmanaged tenant?
        answer: |
          If you see an error like below during your login flow with your email account domain(@yourdomain.com), see the steps below to recover your NuGet.org account.
          
          ![Error during login for AAD accounts](media/unmanaged-aad-tenant.png)
          
      - question: What is this unmanaged state thing during login? And why is this happening now? 
        answer: |
          Your account seems to be previously registered as a personal Microsoft account and it worked fine, however, now it seems like your account has been registered as an "Unmanaged" tenant in the Azure Active Directory (the identity service which we use to authenticate Microsoft accounts). 
          
          This could have happened if you or someone from your organization(with @yourdomain.com email address) registered with one of the AAD integrated services or did a [self-service signup for Azure Active Directory](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-self-service-signup), which creates such an "Unmanaged" tenant for the used Microsoft account domain(@yourdomain.com in your case). 
          
      - question: What can I do to recover my account?
        answer: |
          At this moment there is not a way for us (NuGet.org) to authenticate accounts with such "Unmanaged" tenant accounts in Azure Active directory. We are looking in to a better way to authenticate such accounts.
          
          If you want to login to NuGet.org with your Microsoft account(@yourdomain.com), you(or an administrator at your company) will need to claim the ownership of the AAD by doing a DNS validation to authenticate users with email address "@yourdomain.com". Please follow the steps for [domains admin takeover](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/domains-admin-takeover) documented by the Azure Active directory. Once this is done, your normal login should start working.
          
      - question: How do I change my NuGet.org account username?
        answer: |
          You cannot. As a matter of policy we do not allow the change of usernames. Also, doing so is a breaking change for users that may have defined [package trust policies based on the package owner](../consume-packages/installing-signed-packages.md#trust-package-owners). The only way to change your username is to create a new account with the desired username. We recommend you delete your existing account before you create a new one, otherwise you will not be able to reuse your registered Microsoft account.
          > [!Important]
          > Deleting the user will still **reserve** the `username`. You will not be able to reuse the same username again and **this includes the change of casings**. As an example if you created a user with username `mycoolname` and you want to change this to `MyCoolName`(casing changes), it will not be possible after deleting the user.
          
          Follow the steps given in [delete your NuGet.org account](#how-to-delete-my-nuget-org-account) section and to [register a new account](individual-accounts.md) with correct username.
          
      - question: How to delete my NuGet.org account?
        answer: |
          To delete your account, please note that we recommend that you transfer the ownership of any packages where you are the sole owner. You can read more about [managing package owners](../nuget-org/publish-a-package.md#managing-package-owners-on-nugetorg) on how to do it. This will also help us expedite your request.
          
          If you are looking to transform your account to an organization, follow the steps given in [transform my NuGet.org account to an organization](#how-to-transform-my-nuget-org-account-to-an-organization).
          
          > [!Important]
          > Deleting the user will result in following:
          >  1. Your username will be reserved and no one will be able to re-use it to create an individual account or an organization account
          >  1. Revoke associated API key(s). 
          >  1. Remove the account as an owner for any child packages.
          >  1. Dissociate all previously existent ID prefix reservations with this account.
          >  1. Remove the account as a member of any organizations.
          
          Follow the following steps to proceed with account deletion.
          1. [Login to NuGet.org](https://www.nuget.org/users/account/LogOn) with the account you wish to delete.
          2. Click on this url: [https://www.nuget.org/account/delete](https://www.nuget.org/account/delete) and follow the steps to submit the request for deleting the account.
          
          Our customer support will process this request and perform the account deletion.
