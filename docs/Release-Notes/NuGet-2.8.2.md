# NuGet 2.8.2 Release Notes

[NuGet 2.8.1 Release Notes](../release-notes/nuget-2.8.1.md) | [NuGet 2.8.3 Release Notes](../release-notes/nuget-2.8.3.md)

NuGet 2.8.2 was released on May 22, 2014.  This release only included changes to the NuGet.exe command-line, the NuGet.Server package and other NuGet packages.  The release did not include an updated Visual Studio extension or WebMatrix extension.
