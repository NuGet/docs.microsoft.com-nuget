# NuGet 3.4-RC Release Notes

[NuGet 3.3 Release Notes](../release-notes/nuget-3.3.md) | [NuGet 3.4 Release Notes](../release-notes/nuget-3.4.md)

NuGet 3.4-RC was released March 3, 2016 alongside the Visual Studio 2015 Update 2 RC and was built with a few tenets in minds:

*  Cross-Platform support
*  Performance improvements
*  Minor UI improvements

The following features are available in this RC, with more planned for the 3.4 final release.

## New Features

* NuGet clients now support gzip content-encoding from repositories
* Support for PDBs from packages in xproj projects
* Support for iOS and Android build actions in the contentFiles element
* Support for the netstandard and netstandardapp framework monikers

## New User Interface Features

* Significant performance improvements especially on the Installed, Updates, and Consolidate tabs
* Installed and Updates tabs are now sorted alphabetically
* Added a Refresh button that allows a search to be refreshed

## Updates and Improvements

* Packages referenced in project.json that have a floating version will not update on every build. Instead, they will update only when forced to restore, clean, rebuild, or modify project.json.
* NuGet.org repository sources are no longer forced into a project configuration when you use the NuGet configuration UI.
* NuGet no longer restores packages in shared projects nor writes a lock file.
* We've improved network failure and retry handling for unreachable or slow-to-respond servers.
* Keyboard and mouse behaviors are improved in the Visual Studio Package Manager UI.
* We now support the latest project.json schema in DNX.
