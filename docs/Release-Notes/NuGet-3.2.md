# NuGet 3.2 Release Notes

[NuGet 3.2-RC Release Notes](../release-notes/nuget-3.2-RC.md) | [NuGet 3.2.1 Release Notes](../release-notes/nuget-3.2.1.md)

NuGet 3.2 was released September 16, 2015 as a collection of improvements and fixes for the 3.1.1 release and is available from both [dist.nuget.org](http://dist.nuget.org/index.html) and the [Visual Studio Gallery](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/5d345edc-2e2d-4a9c-b73b-d53956dc458d?SRC=Home).

## New Features

* Projects that live in the same folder can now have different project.json files in that folder specific to each project.  For each project, name the project.json file {ProjectName}.project.json and NuGet will give preference to that configuration for each project appropriately.  This is only supported with Windows 10 Tools v1.1 installed -  [1102](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/1102)
* NuGet clients support specifying a global NUGET_PACKAGES environment variable to specify the location of the shared global packages folder used in project.json managed projects with Windows 10 tools v1.1.

## Command-line updates

This is the first version of the NuGet.exe client that supports the NuGet v3 servers and restoring packages for projects managed with a project.json file.

##### There were a number of authenticated feed issues that were addressed in this release to improve interactions with the client.

* Install / restore interactions only submit credentials for the initial request to the authenticated feed - [1300](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/1300), [456](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/456)
* Push command does not resolve credentials from configuration - [1248](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/1248)
* User agent and headers are now submitted to NuGet repositories to help with statistics tracking - [929](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/929)

##### We made a number of improvements to better handle network failures while attempting to work with a remote NuGet repository:

* Improved error messages when unable to connect to remote feeds - [1238](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/1238)
* Corrected NuGet restore command to properly return a 1 when an error condition occurs - [1186](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/1186)
* Now retrying network connections every 200ms for a maximum of 5 attempts in the case of HTTP 5xx failures - [1120](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/1120)
* Improved handling of server redirect responses during a push command - [1051](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/1051)
* `nuget install -source` now supports either URL or repository name from nuget.config as an argument - [1046](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/1046)
* Missing packages that were not located on a repository during a restore are now reported as errors instead of warnings [1038](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/1038)
* Corrected multipartwebrequest handling of \r\n for Unix/Linux scenarios - [776](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/776)

##### There are a number of fixes to issues with various commands:

* Push command no longer does a GET before a PUT against a package source - [1237](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/1237)
* List command no longer repeats version numbers - [1185](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/1185)
* Pack with the -build argument now properly supports C# 6.0 - [1107](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/1107)
* Corrected issues attempting to pack an F# project built with Visual Studio 2015 - [1048](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/1048)
* Restore now no-ops when packages already exist - [1040](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/1040)
* Improved error messages when packages.config file is malformed - [1034](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/1034)
* Corrected restore command with -SolutionDirectory switch to work with relative paths - [992](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/992)
* Improved Updated command to support solution-wide update - [924](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/924)

A complete list of issues addressed in this release can be found in the NuGet GitHub [Command-Line milestone](https://github.com/nuget/home/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A3.2.0-commandline+is%3Aclosed+-label%3AClosedAs%3ADuplicate).

## Visual Studio extension updates

### New Features in Visual Studio

* A new context menu item was added to the Solution Explorer on the solution node that allows packages to be restored without building the solution ([1274](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/1274)).

### Updates and Fixes in Visual Studio

##### The fixes for authenticated feeds were rolled up and addressed in the extension as well.  The following authentication items were also addressed in the extension:

* Now correctly treating NuGet v3 authenticated feeds properly, instead of as v2 authenticated feeds - [1216](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/1216)
* Corrected request for authentication credentials in projects using project.json and communicating with v2 feeds - [1082](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/1082)

* Now continuing to build projects if restoring packages for a single project fails - [1169](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/1169)
* Installing a package into a project that is depended on by another project in the solution forces a solution rebuild - [981](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/981)

* No longer modifying nuget.config files during ASP.NET 5 solution build - [1201](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/1201)

* Now properly displaying the installed version of a package in the user interface - [1061](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/1061)
* Packages with dependency ranges specified in their nuspec now have pre-release versions of those dependencies installed for a stable package version - [1304](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/1304)
