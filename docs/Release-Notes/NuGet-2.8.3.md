NuGet 2.8.3 was released October 17, 2014. It is a minor update to our 2.8.1 VSIX with some targeted fixes.

In this release, the support for NuGet Package Manager dialog was added for [ASP.NET vNext](http://www.asp.net/vnext), [DevExtreme](http://js.devexpress.com/) and [BizTalk (.btproj)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa577497.aspx) project types. It also includes reliability bug fixes related to the scenarios of enabling package restore and saving package manager options.
