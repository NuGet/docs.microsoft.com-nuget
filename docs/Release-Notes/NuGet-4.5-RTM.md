# 4.5 RTM Release Notes

[Visual Studio 2017 15.5 RTW](https://www.visualstudio.com/news/releasenotes/vs2017-relnotes) comes with NuGet 4.5 RTM.

## Known issues

### Issues with .NET Standard 2.0 with .NET Framework & NuGet 
.NET Standard & its tooling was designed such that projects targeting .NET Framework 4.6.1 can consume NuGet packages & projects targeting .NET Standard 2.0 or earlier. [This document](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/481) summarizes the issues around that scenario, the plan for addressing them, and workarounds you can deploy with today's state of the tooling.

### You will be unable to view, add, or update DotNetCLITools, using Nuget Package Manager

#### Issue:
NuGet Package Manager does not display and does not allow add/update of DotNetCLITools. [NuGet#4256](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/4256)

#### Workaround:
DotNetCLIToolReferences must be manually edited in your project file.

### Retargeting target framework version may lead to incomplete Intellisense

#### Issue:
Retargeting target framework version may lead to incomplete Intellisense, in Visual Studio. This happens when you are using PackageReferences as the package manager format. [NuGet#4216](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/4216)

#### Workaround:
Do a manual restore.


### A package in a .NET Core project that contains an assembly with an invalid signature, can trigger an infinite restore loop

#### Issue:
Occasionally, when you use a package that contains an assembly with an invalid signature or when the package version is set with 'DateTime' ticker, it causes the package auto-restore to run in an infinite loop [dotnet/project-system#1457](https://github.com/dotnet/project-system/issues/1457).

#### Workaround:
There is no workaround at this time.
