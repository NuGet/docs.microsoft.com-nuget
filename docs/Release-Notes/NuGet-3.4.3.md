NuGet 3.4.3 was released on April 22, 2016 to address several issues that were identified in the 3.4 and subsequent releases.

You can download both the VSIX and NuGet.exe [here](https://dist.nuget.org/index.html).

## Updates and Improvements

## Fixes

* Fixed some authorization issues with password protected private nuget feeds.
* Fixed an issue around being unable to restore PCL's from project.json with runtimes specified.
* Some customers were running into intermittent failures when installing packages. This has now been fixed in this release.
* Fixed an issue that caused restore failures in C++/CLI projects with project.json.
* Some packages (E.g ModernHttpClient) where not being unzipped correctly when you use nuget in mono. This has now been fixed in this release.
