Errors from the `push` command typically indicate the problem. For example, you might have forgotten to update the version number in your project, so you're trying to publish a package that already exists.

You also see errors if your API key is invalid or expired, or if you try to publish a package using an identifier that already exists on the host. Suppose, for example, the identifier `AppLogger-test` already exists on nuget.org. If you try to publish a package with that identifier, the `push` command gives the following error:

   ```output
   Response status code does not indicate success: 403 (The specified API key is invalid,
   has expired, or does not have permission to access the specified package.).
   ```

If you get this error, check that you're using a valid API key that hasn't expired. If you are, the error indicates the package identifier already exists on the host. To fix the error, change the package identifier to be unique, rebuild the project, recreate the *.nupkg* file, and retry the `push` command.
