# Sync-Package (Package Manager Console in Visual Studio)

*Version 3.0+; available only within the [NuGet Package Manager Console](package-manager-console.md) in Visual Studio on Windows.*

Gets the version of installed package from specified (or default) project and synchronizes the version to the rest of projects in the solution.

## Syntax

```ps
Sync-Package [-Id] <string> [-IgnoreDependencies] [-ProjectName <string>] [[-Version] <string>]
    [[-Source] <string>] [-IncludePrerelease] [-FileConflictAction] [-DependencyVersion]
    [-WhatIf] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Id | (Required) The identifier of the package to sync. The -Id switch itself is optional. |
| IgnoreDependencies | Install only this package and not its dependencies. |
| ProjectName | The project to sync the package from, defaulting to the default  project. |
| Version | The version of the package to sync, defaulting to the currently installed version. |

| WhatIf | Shows what would happen when running the command without actually performing the sync. |

None of these parameters accept pipeline input or wildcard characters.
