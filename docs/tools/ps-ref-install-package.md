# Install-Package (Package Manager Console in Visual Studio)

*This topic describes the command within the [NuGet Package Manager Console](package-manager-console.md) in Visual Studio on Windows. For the generic PowerShell Install-Package command, see the [PowerShell PackageManagement reference](/powershell/module/packagemanagement/?view=powershell-6).*

Installs a package and its dependencies into a project.

## Syntax

```ps
Install-Package [-Id] <string> [-IgnoreDependencies] [-ProjectName <string>] [[-Source] <string>] 
    [[-Version] <string>] [-IncludePrerelease] [-FileConflictAction] [-DependencyVersion]
    [-WhatIf] [<CommonParameters>]
```

In NuGet 2.8+, `Install-Package` can downgrade an existing package in your project. For example, if you have Microsoft.AspNet.MVC 5.1.0-rc1 installed, the following command would downgrade it to 5.0.0:

```ps
Install-Package Microsoft.AspNet.MVC -Version 5.0.0.
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Id | (Required) The identifier of the package to install. (*3.0+*) The identifier can be a path or URL of a `packages.config` file or a `.nupkg` file. The -Id switch itself is optional. |
| IgnoreDependencies | Install only this package and not its dependencies. |
| ProjectName | The project into which to install the package, defaulting to the default project. |
| Source | The URL or folder path for the package source to search. Local folder paths can be absolute, or relative to the current folder. If omitted, `Install-Package` searches the currently selected package source. |
| Version | The version of the package to install, defaulting to the latest version. |
| IncludePrerelease | Considers prerelease packages for the install. If omitted, only stable packages are considered. |
| FileConflictAction | The action to take when asked to overwrite or ignore existing files referenced by the project. Possible values are *Overwrite, Ignore, None, OverwriteAll*, and *(3.0+)* *IgnoreAll*. |
| DependencyVersion | The version of the dependency packages to use, which can be one of the following:<br/><ul><li>*Lowest* (default): the lowest version</li><li>*HighestPatch*: the version with the lowest major, lowest minor, highest patch</li><li>*HighestMinor*: the version with the lowest major, highest minor, highest patch</li><li>*Highest* (default for Update-Package with no parameters): the highest version</li></ul>You can set the default value using the [`dependencyVersion`](../reference/nuget-config-file.md#config-section) setting in the `Nuget.Config` file. |
| WhatIf | Shows what would happen when running the command without actually performing the install. |

None of these parameters accept pipeline input or wildcard characters.
