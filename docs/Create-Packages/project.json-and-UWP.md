# project.json and UWP

This document describes a new package structure that can be used to take advantage of new features in NuGet v3. The *minClientVersion* property of your NuSpec can be used to state that you require the new features described here by setting it to 3.1. Note that NuGet v3 is available in Visual Studio 2015 and newer.

## Adding UWP support to an existing package

If you have an existing package and you want to add support for UWP applications then you don’t need to adopt the new packaging format described here. You only need to adopt this format if you require the features it describes and are willing to only work with clients that have updated to the latest version of the NuGet client.

## I already target netcore45

If you target netcore45 already, and you don’t need to take advantage of anything new then you don’t need to do anything, netcore45 will be consumed by UWP applications.

## I want to take advantage of Windows 10 specific APIs

In this case you need to add the uap10.0 TxM to your package. Create a new directory in your package and add the assembly that has been compiled to work with Windows 10 to that directory.

## I don’t need Windows 10 specific APIs, but want new .NET features or don’t have netcore45 already

In this case you would add the new dotnet TxM to your package. Unlike other TxMs dotnet doesn’t imply a surface area or platform. It is stating that your package will work on any platform that your dependencies work on. When building a package with the dotnet TxM you are likely to have many more TxM specific dependencies in your NuSpec, as you will need to define the BCL packages you depend on, such System.Text, System.Xml, etc. The locations that those dependencies work on define where your package will work.

### How do I find out my dependencies

There are two ways to figure out which dependencies to list:

1. Use `ILDasm` to look at your dll to see what assemblies are actually needed at runtime. Then determine which NuGet package they each come from. This is the hard way.
2. Use the [NuSpec Dependency Generator](https://github.com/onovotny/ReferenceGenerator) **3rd party** tool. The tool automates the process and updates your .nuspec file with the dependant packages on build. It is available via a NuGet package, [NuSpec.ReferenceGenerator](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NuSpec.ReferenceGenerator/).

See the project.json document for details on supports and includes features that both help in the creation of a package that support the dotnet TxM.

**If your package is intended to work with the new PCL project, we highly recommend to create a dotnet folder, to avoid warnings and potential compatibility issues.**



## Directory Structure

NuGet packages using the new format have the following well-known directories and behaviors:

* Build
  * MSBuild targets and props files in this folder are integrated differently into the project, but otherwise there is no change.

* Tools
  * Install.ps1 and uninstall.ps1 will no longer run. Init.ps1 works as it always has.

* Content
  * Content will no longer be copied automatically into a user’s project. Support for content inclusion in the project is planned for a later release

* Lib
  * For many packages the lib will work the same way it does in the 2.0, but with expanded options for what names can be used inside it and better logic for picking the correct sub-directory when consuming packages. However, when used in conjunction with ref, the lib folder will contain assemblies that implement the surface area defined by the assemblies in the ref folder.

* Ref
  * ref is a new, optional, directory that contains .NET assemblies defining the public surface (public types and methods) for an application to compile against. The assemblies in this folder may have no implementation, they are purely used to define surface area for the compiler. If the package has no ref directory, then the lib is both the reference assembly and the implementation assembly.

* Runtimes
  * runtimes is a new, optional, directory that will contain OS specific code, such as CPU architecture and OS specific or otherwise platform-dependent binaries.


## MSBuild targets and props files in packages

NuGet packages can contain .props and .targets files which will be imported into any MSBuild project that the package is installed into. In NuGet 2.x, this was done by injecting &lt;Import&gt; statements into the .csproj file, in NuGet 3.0 there is no specific "installation to project" action. Instead the package restore process writes two files:

* [projectname].nuget.props

* [projectname].nuget.targets

MSBuild knows to look for these two files and automatically imports them near the beginning and near the end of the project build process. This provides very similar behavior to NuGet 2, but with one major difference: **There is no guaranteed order of targets/props files in this case**. However, MSBuild does provide ways to order Targets through the BeforeTargets and AfterTargets attributes of the &lt;Target&gt; definition (see [https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/t50z2hka.aspx](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/t50z2hka.aspx)).


## Lib and Ref

The behavior of the Lib directory hasn't changed significantly in NuGet v3. However, all assemblies must be within sub-folders named after a TxM, and can no longer be placed directly under the lib folder. A TxM is the name of a platform that a given asset in a package is supposed to work for. Logically these are an extension of the Target Framework Monikers (TFM) e.g. *net45*, *net46*, *netcore50*, and *dnxcore50* are all examples of TxMs. We use a new term TxM because a TxM can refer to a framework (TFM) as well as other platform specific surface area. For example the UWP TxM (UAP10.0) represents the .NET surface area as well as the Windows surface area for UWP applications.

An example lib structure:

    lib
    ├───net40
    │       MyLibrary.dll
    └───wp81
            MyLibrary.dll

The lib folder contains assemblies that will be used at runtime. For most packages a directory under lib for each of the target TxMs is all that is required.

## Ref

There are sometimes cases where a different assembly should be used during compilation (.NET Reference Assemblies do this today). For those cases, we are introducing a new top-level folder called *ref* (short for "Reference Assemblies").

Most package authors will not require the ref directory. It is useful for packages that need to provide a consistent surface area for compilation and intellisense but then have different implementation for different TxMs. The biggest use case of this will be the System.* packages that are being produced as part of shipping .NET Core on NuGet. These packages have various implementations that are being unified by a consistent set of ref assemblies.

Mechanically, the assemblies included in the ref folder are the reference assemblies being passed to the compiler. For those of you who have used csc.exe these are the assemblies we are passing to the /reference ([https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/yabyz3h4.aspx](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/yabyz3h4.aspx)) switch.

The structure of the ref folder is the same as lib, for example:

    └───MyImageProcessingLib
         ├───lib
         │   ├───net40
         │   │       MyImageProcessingLibrary.dll
         │   │
         │   ├───net451
         │   │       MyImageProcessingLibrary.dll
         │   │
         │   └───win81
         │           MyImageProcessingLibrary.dll
         │
         └───ref
             ├───net40
             │       MyImageProcessingLibrary.dll
             │
             └───portable-net451-win81
                     MyImageProcessingLibrary.dll


In this example the assemblies in the ref directories would all be identical.


## Runtimes

The runtimes folder contains assemblies and native libraries required to run on specific "runtimes", which are generally defined by Operating System and CPU architecture. These runtimes are identified using Runtime Identifiers (RIDs) such as win, win-x86, win7-x86, win8-64, etc.

## Native light-up

In the following example we will show a package that has a purely managed implementation for several platforms, but will use native helpers on Windows 8 where it can call into Windows 8 specific native APIs.

    └───MyLibrary
         ├───lib
         │   └───net40
         │           MyLibrary.dll
         │
         └───runtimes
             ├───win8-x64
             │   ├───lib
             │   │   └───net40
             │   │           MyLibrary.dll
             │   │
             │   └───native
             │           MyNativeLibrary.dll
             │
             └───win8-x86
                 ├───lib
                 │   └───net40
                 │           MyLibrary.dll
                 │
                 └───native
                         MyNativeLibrary.dll

Given the above package the following things will happen:

* When not on Windows 8 the *lib/net40/MyLibrary.dll* assembly will be used.

* When on Windows 8 the *runtimes/win8-&lt;architecture&gt;/lib/MyLibrary.dll* will be used and the native/MyNativeHelper.dll will be copied to the output of your build.

In the example above the *lib/net40* assembly is purely managed code, whilst the assemblies in the runtimes folder will p/invoke into the native helper assembly to call APIs specific to Windows 8.

Only a single lib directory will ever be picked, so if there is a runtime specific directory it will be chosen over non-runtime specific lib. The native directory is additive, if it exists it will be copied to the output of the build.

## Managed wrapper

Another way to use runtimes is to ship a package that is purely a managed wrapper over a native assembly. In this scenario you create a package like the following:

    └───MyLibrary
         └───runtimes
             ├───win8-x64
             │   ├───lib
             │   │   └───net451
             │   │           MyLibrary.dll
             │   │
             │   └───native
             │           MyImplementation.dll
             │
             └───win8-x86
                 ├───lib
                 │   └───net451
                 │           MyLibrary.dll
                 │
                 └───native
                         MyImplementation.dll

In this case there is no top-level lib folder as that folder as there is no implementation of this package that doesn’t rely on the corresponding native assembly. If the managed assembly, MyLibrary.dll, was exactly the same in both of these cases then we could put it in a top level lib folder, but because the lack of a native assembly doesn’t cause the package to fail installing if it was installed on a platform that wasn’t win-x86 or win-x64 then the top level lib would be used but no native assembly would be copied.


## Authoring packages for NuGet 2 and NuGet 3

If you want to create a package that can be consumed by projects using packages.config as well as packages using project.json then the following apply:

* Ref and runtimes only work on NuGet 3. They will both be ignored by NuGet 2.

* You cannot rely on install.ps1 or uninstall.ps1 to function. These files will execute when using packages.config, but will be ignored in v3. So your package needs to be usable without them running. Init.ps1 will still run on NuGet 3.

* Targets and Props installation is different, you will need to make sure that your package works as expected on both clients.

* Subdirectories of lib must be a TxM in NuGet 3. You cannot place libraries at the root of the lib folder.

* Content will no longer be copied automatically. If you package relies on the files in content being copied into the users project then this will not happen on NuGet 3. Consumers of your package could copy the files themselves or use a tool like a task runner to automate copying the files.

* You cannot rely on transforms, like web.config transformation. Transforms are not run by the NuGet 3 client.

If you are supporting NuGet 2 and 3 then your minClientVersion should be the lowest version of NuGet 2 client that your package works on. In the case of an existing package it shouldn’t need to change.
