# MSBuild .props and .targets in a package

In additional to the more traditional assemblies, NuGet packages may sometimes add custom build targets or properties to projects that consume that package.
This can be achieved by adding a valid MSBuild file, in the form `<package_id>.targets` or `<package_id>.props` (such as `Contoso.Utility.UsefulStuff.targets`) within the build folders of the project.

## Build folders

As NuGet has evolved, various different folders for build `.props` and `.targets` have been added.

| Folder | NuGet Version | Use |
|--------|---------------|-----|
| build | 2.5+ | Build logic for every framework of a project. |
| buildMultiTargetting | 4.0+ | Build logic for the `outer build` for projects that target multiple frameworks. PackageReference only. |
| buildTransitive | 5.0+ | Build logic for assets that flow transitively to any consuming project. See the [feature](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/wiki/Allow-package--authors-to-define-build-assets-transitive-behavior) page. PackageReference only. |

## Framework specific build folder

All 3 build folder follow the same pattern for deciding the most suitable file based on the project target framework.

Files in the root build folder, `build/<package_id>.targets` and `build/<package_id>.props` are considered suitable for all target frameworks.

To provide framework-specific files, first place them within appropriate subfolders, such as the following:

```text
    \build
        \netstandard1.4
            \Contoso.Utility.UsefulStuff.props
            \Contoso.Utility.UsefulStuff.targets
        \net462
            \Contoso.Utility.UsefulStuff.props
            \Contoso.Utility.UsefulStuff.targets
```

Prefer using framework-specific build folders whenever appropriate to avoid false positive installations in projects that may not be supported by your package.

Note that if a package does not have any files in the `lib` or `ref` folders and only files under a framework specific build folder, that package will be considered compatible with all projects. Up to date versions of the pack tooling, raise the  [NU5127](..\reference\errors-and-warnings\NU5127.md) warning when such packages are created.

## Projects consuming packages with build files

### PackageReference projects

`.props` and `.targets` are not added to the project file but are instead made available through `{projectName}.nuget.g.targets` and `{projectName}.nuget.g.props`. These files are automatically generated when restore is run.

When a project targets more than one framework, the imports to these files are conditioned on the target framework name.

MSBuild `.props` and `.targets` files for multi-framework targeting can be placed in the `\buildMultiTargeting` folder.
When the imports are generated, a condition that the MSBuild property `$(TargetFramework)` is empty is set.

### packages.config projects

When NuGet installs a package with `\build` files, it adds MSBuild `<Import>` elements in the project file pointing to the `.targets` and `.props` files. (`.props` is added at the top of the project file; `.targets` is added at the bottom.) A separate conditional MSBuild `<Import>` element is added for each target framework.

## Authoring packages with MSBuild props and targets

You can use any of the following tools to include MSBuild `.props` and `.targets` in your package.

- [NuGet.exe pack](..\create-packages\Creating-a-Package.md#include-msbuild-props-and-targets-in-a-package)
- [dotnet.exe pack](..\create-packages\creating-a-package-dotnet-cli.md)
- [MSBuild.exe pack](..\create-packages\creating-a-package-msbuild.md)

### Guidance for the content of MSBuild props and targets

NuGet does not limit how you author `.props` and `.targets` as they will vary based on the need of the package author and the target projects themselves.

There are a few things that must not be done in packages' `.props` and `.targets`, such as not specifying properties and items that affect restore, as those will be automatically excluded.

- Some examples of properties that must not be added or updated: TargetFramework, TargetFrameworkMoniker, TargetPlatformMoniker, AssetTargetFallback etc.

- Some examples of items that must not be added or updated: PackageReference, PackageVersion, PackageDownload, etc.
