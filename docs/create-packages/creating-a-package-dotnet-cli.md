# Create a NuGet package using the dotnet CLI

No matter what your package does or what code it contains, you use one of the CLI tools, either `nuget.exe` or `dotnet.exe`, to package that functionality into a component that can be shared with and used by any number of other developers. This article describes how to create a package using the dotnet CLI. To install the `dotnet` CLI, see [Install NuGet client tools](../install-nuget-client-tools.md). Starting in Visual Studio 2017, the dotnet CLI is included with .NET Core workloads.

For .NET Core and .NET Standard projects that use the [SDK-style format](../resources/check-project-format.md), and any other SDK-style projects, NuGet uses information in the project file directly to create a package. For step-by-step tutorials, see [Create .NET Standard Packages with dotnet CLI](../quickstart/create-and-publish-a-package-using-the-dotnet-cli.md) or [Create .NET Standard Packages with Visual Studio](../quickstart/create-and-publish-a-package-using-visual-studio.md).

`msbuild -t:pack` is functionality equivalent to `dotnet pack`. To build with MSBuild, see [Create a NuGet package using MSBuild](creating-a-package-msbuild.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This topic applies to [SDK-style](../resources/check-project-format.md) projects, typically .NET Core and .NET Standard projects.

## Set properties

The following properties are required to create a package.

- `PackageId`, the package identifier, which must be unique across the gallery that hosts the package. If not specified, the default value is `AssemblyName`.
- `Version`, a specific version number in the form *Major.Minor.Patch[-Suffix]* where *-Suffix* identifies [pre-release versions](prerelease-packages.md). If not specified, the default value is 1.0.0.
- The package title as it should appear on the host (like nuget.org)
- `Authors`, author and owner information. If not specified, the default value is `AssemblyName`.
- `Company`, your company name. If not specified, the default value is `AssemblyName`.

In Visual Studio, you can set these values in the project properties (right-click the project in Solution Explorer, choose **Properties**, and select the **Package** tab). You can also set these properties directly in the project files (`.csproj`).

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <PackageId>AppLogger</PackageId>
  <Version>1.0.0</Version>
  <Authors>your_name</Authors>
  <Company>your_company</Company>
</PropertyGroup>
```

> [!Important]
> Give the package an identifier that's unique across nuget.org or whatever package source you're using.

The following example shows a simple, complete project file with these properties included. (You can create a new default project using the `dotnet new classlib` command.)

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>netstandard2.0</TargetFramework>
    <PackageId>AppLogger</PackageId>
    <Version>1.0.0</Version>
    <Authors>your_name</Authors>
    <Company>your_company</Company>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

You can also set the optional properties, such as `Title`, `PackageDescription`, and `PackageTags`, as described in [MSBuild pack targets](../reference/msbuild-targets.md#pack-target), [Controlling dependency assets](../consume-packages/package-references-in-project-files.md#controlling-dependency-assets), and [NuGet metadata properties](/dotnet/core/tools/csproj#nuget-metadata-properties).

> [!NOTE]
> For packages built for public consumption, pay special attention to the **PackageTags** property, as tags help others find your package and understand what it does.

For details on declaring dependencies and specifying version numbers, see [Package references in project files](../consume-packages/package-references-in-project-files.md) and [Package versioning](../concepts/package-versioning.md). It is also possible to surface assets from dependencies directly in the package by using the `<IncludeAssets>` and `<ExcludeAssets>` attributes. For more information, seee [Controlling dependency assets](../consume-packages/package-references-in-project-files.md#controlling-dependency-assets).

## Add an optional description field

[!INCLUDE [add description to package](includes/add-description.md)]

## Choose a unique package identifier and set the version number

[!INCLUDE [choose-package-id](includes/choose-package-id.md)]

## Run the pack command

To build a NuGet package (a `.nupkg` file) from the project, run the `dotnet pack` command, which also builds the project automatically:

```dotnetcli
# Uses the project file in the current folder by default
dotnet pack
```

The output shows the path to the `.nupkg` file.

```output
Microsoft (R) Build Engine version 15.5.180.51428 for .NET Core
Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

  Restore completed in 29.91 ms for D:\proj\AppLoggerNet\AppLogger\AppLogger.csproj.
  AppLogger -> D:\proj\AppLoggerNet\AppLogger\bin\Debug\netstandard2.0\AppLogger.dll
  Successfully created package 'D:\proj\AppLoggerNet\AppLogger\bin\Debug\AppLogger.1.0.0.nupkg'.
```

### Automatically generate package on build

To automatically run `dotnet pack` when you run `dotnet build`, add the following line to your project file within `<PropertyGroup>`:

```xml
<GeneratePackageOnBuild>true</GeneratePackageOnBuild>
```

When you run `dotnet pack` on a solution, this packs all the projects in the solution that are packable ([<IsPackable>](/dotnet/core/tools/csproj#nuget-metadata-properties) property is set to `true`).

> [!NOTE]
> When you automatically generate the package, the time to pack increases the build time for your project.

### Test package installation

Before publishing a package, you typically want to test the process of installing a package into a project. The tests make sure that the necessary files all end up in their correct places in the project.

You can test installations manually in Visual Studio or on the command line using the normal [package installation steps](../consume-packages/overview-and-workflow.md#ways-to-install-a-nuget-package).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Packages are immutable. If you correct a problem, change the contents of the package and pack again, when you retest you will still be using the old version of the package until you [clear your global packages](../consume-packages/managing-the-global-packages-and-cache-folders.md#clearing-local-folders) folder. This is especially relevant when testing packages that don't use a unique prerelease label on every build.

## Next Steps

Once you've created a package, which is a `.nupkg` file, you can publish it to the gallery of your choice as described on [Publishing a Package](../nuget-org/publish-a-package.md).

You might also want to extend the capabilities of your package or otherwise support other scenarios as described in the following topics:

- [Package versioning](../concepts/package-versioning.md)
- [Support multiple target frameworks](../create-packages/multiple-target-frameworks-project-file.md)
- [Add a package icon](../reference/nuspec.md#icon)
- [Transformations of source and configuration files](../create-packages/source-and-config-file-transformations.md)
- [Localization](../create-packages/creating-localized-packages.md)
- [Pre-release versions](../create-packages/prerelease-packages.md)
- [Set package type](../create-packages/set-package-type.md)
- [Create packages with COM interop assemblies](../create-packages/author-packages-with-COM-interop-assemblies.md)

Finally, there are additional package types to be aware of:

- [Native Packages](../guides/native-packages.md)
- [Symbol Packages](../create-packages/symbol-packages-snupkg.md)
