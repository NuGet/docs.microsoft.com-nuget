# Create NuGet packages that contain COM interop assemblies

Packages that contain COM interop assemblies must include an appropriate [targets file](creating-a-package.md#include-msbuild-props-and-targets-in-a-package) so that the correct `EmbedInteropTypes` metadata is added to projects using the PackageReference format. By default, the `EmbedInteropTypes` metadata is always false for all assemblies when PackageReference is used, so the targets file adds this metadata explicitly. To avoid conflicts, the target name should be unique; ideally, use a combination of your package name and the assembly being embedded, replacing the `{InteropAssemblyName}` in the example below with that value. (Also see [NuGet.Samples.Interop](https://github.com/NuGet/Samples/tree/main/NuGet.Samples.Interop) for an example.)

```xml
<Target Name="Embedding**AssemblyName**From**PackageId**" AfterTargets="ResolveReferences" BeforeTargets="FindReferenceAssembliesForReferences">
  <ItemGroup>
    <ReferencePath Condition=" '%(FileName)' == '{InteropAssemblyName}' AND '%(ReferencePath.NuGetPackageId)' == '$(MSBuildThisFileName)' ">
      <EmbedInteropTypes>true</EmbedInteropTypes>
    </ReferencePath>
  </ItemGroup>
</Target>
```

Note that when using the `packages.config` management format, adding references to the assemblies from the packages causes NuGet and Visual Studio to check for COM interop assemblies and set the `EmbedInteropTypes` to true in the project file. In this case, the targets are overridden.

Additionally, by default the [build assets do not flow transitively](../consume-packages/package-references-in-project-files.md#controlling-dependency-assets). Packages authored as described here work differently when they are pulled as a transitive dependency from a project to project reference. The package consumer can allow them to flow by modifying the PrivateAssets default value to not include build.
