# Including native libraries in .NET packages

This document explains how to create packages that work for projects targeting .NET (5+), where a .NET managed assembly uses [Platform Invoke (P/Invoke)](/dotnet/standard/native-interop/pinvoke) from a .NET managed language project, with the .NET runtime using [probing paths](/dotnet/core/dependency-loading/default-probing) to load and locate the native library.

If you wish to support .NET Framework with your package, see the [section on projects targeting .NET Framework](#projects-targeting-net-framework).
In general, your best option is to package your own [MSBuild props and targets files](../concepts/MSBuild-props-and-targets.md), and handle build and publish targets yourself.
By not using NuGet and the .NET runtime's built in feature,  you need to be sufficiently knowledgeable in MSBuild and the build systems for the relevant project types.

While NuGet has a [`contentFiles/` feature](../reference/msbuild-targets.md#including-content-in-a-package), it is not recommended to use this, as it doesn't support per-RID selection, and therefore doesn't participate in the .NET runtime's probing paths features.

## Background

First we'll consider a project referencing packages.
When the app is published for a specific [Runtime Identifier (RID)](/dotnet/core/rid-catalog), then NuGet package assets for that RID will be copied into the output directory.
When the app is published without a specific RID, all RID specific content will be published in subdirectories, and a `{project}.deps.json` file is created that the .NET runtime loads to determine which directory to use as a probing path.

Also, be aware that .NET 8 introduces breaking changes regarding [how it determines compatible RIDs from the `.deps.json` file](/dotnet/core/compatibility/deployment/8.0/rid-asset-list) and [which RIDs are recognized by the SDK](/dotnet/core/compatibility/sdk/8.0/rid-graph).

## Understanding NuGet package asset selection

There are three types of assets in a NuGet file that are most relevant to this scenario: compile, runtime, and native assets.
For a complete list of asset types, see the docs on [controlling dependency assets in `PackageReference` projects](../consume-packages/Package-References-in-Project-Files.md#controlling-dependency-assets).

|Asset type|Short Description|
|--|--|
|[compile](#compile-assets)|Managed assemblies passed to the compiler. `ref/{tfm}/` if it exists, otherwise `lib/{tfm}/`.|
|[runtime](#runtime-assets)|Managed assemblies copied to the output directory. `runtimes/{rid}/lib/{tfm}/` if it exists, otherwise `lib/{tfm}/`.|
|[native](#native-assets)|Native libraries copied to the output directory. `runtimes/{rid}/native/`.|

In all cases, NuGet chooses the "most compatible" directory for a given RID and Target Framework, and only the files in that directory are copied.
Therefore, you cannot put common assets in an inherited RID (such as `any`), because if any other RID is a better match, the `any` RID contents will not be considered.

To inspect the implementation of NuGet's asset selection, see [`NuGet.Client`'s `ManagedCodeConventions.cs` file](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/blob/dev/src/NuGet.Core/NuGet.Packaging/ContentModel/ManagedCodeConventions.cs).

### Compile assets

Compile assets are passed to the compiler, and therefore must only contain .NET assemblies.
NuGet will select compile assets from `ref/{tfm}/`, and if that directory does not exist, it will fall back to `lib/{tfm}`, where `{tfm}` is the target framework that is the closest match the project referencing the package.
However, in this scenario of creating a .NET package with native libraries, it is recommended to use `ref/` because if `lib/` is used, NuGet will think the package is compatible with projects using `packages.config`, but those projects will fail at runtime because the native files will not be copied.

The .NET compiler will generate warnings when an assembly targets a different architecture than what the current compilation is targeting, so your package consumers will have the best experience if your `ref/` or `lib/` assemblies target `AnyCPU`.

If your assembly contains a lot of managed code, not just P/Invoke method definitions, you can save space by making the `ref/` assembly a [reference assembly](/dotnet/standard/assembly/reference-assemblies#generating-reference-assemblies), but be sure to include it under `ref/` in your package, not `lib/`.

Therefore, there is no capability to provide different compile-time assemblies for different RIDs, you will need to provide the same API surface for all RIDs, and do runtime checks (for example, throw `PlatformNotSupportedException`).

### Runtime assets

Runtime assets are .NET managed assemblies copied to the output directory on build and publish, and the .NET SDK generates the `deps.json` with all the RID-specific asset information.
NuGet will select runtime assets from `runtimes/{rid}/lib/{tfm}/`, and if that doesn't exist, then it will fall back to `lib/{tfm}/`.
The best `{rid}` directory is selected first, followed by `{tfm}`.
However, in this scenario of creating a .NET package with native libraries, it is recommended to use `runtimes/` because if `lib/` is used, NuGet will think the package is compatible with projects using `packages.config`, but those projects will fail at runtime because the native assets will not be copied.

### Native assets

Native assets are also copied to the output directory on build and publish, and are present in the `deps.json` file.
NuGet will select native assets from the `runtimes/{rid}/native/` directory.

> [!NOTE]
> The [.NET SDK flattens any directory structure](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/9643) under `runtimes/{rid}/native/` when copying to the output directory.

## Putting it together

How to build any binaries native libraries is out of scope of this document.
It is assumed that all the native binaries and the .NET assemblies have been completed and copied to a machine for packing.

When packing with [NuGet's MSBuild Pack target](../reference/msbuild-targets.md#pack-target), you can include arbitrary files in arbitrary package paths using `Pack="true" PackagePath="{path}"` metadata on MSBuild items.
For example, `<None Include="../cross-compile/linux-x64/libcontoso.so" Pack="true" PackagePath="runtimes/linux-x64/native/" />`.

Consider a package `Contoso.Native` that provides .NET APIs to `contoso.dll` on Windows, `libcontoso.dylib` on OSX, and `libcontoso.so` on Linux, using `[DllImport("contoso")]`.
The package contents should be (excluding files required by the [Open Packaging Conventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Packaging_Conventions))

### Example 1

If `Contoso.Native` is built as AnyCPU:

```text
Contoso.Native.1.0.0.nuspec
ref/net8.0/Contoso.Native.dll
runtimes/any/lib/net8.0/Contoso.Native.dll
runtimes/linux-arm64/native/libcontoso.so
runtimes/linux-x64/native/libcontoso.so
runtimes/osx-arm64/native/libcontoso.dylib
runtimes/osx-x64/native/libcontoso.dylib
runtimes/win-arm64/native/contoso.dll
runtimes/win-x64/native/contoso.dll
```

While the `ref/` and `runtimes/any/lib` copies of `Contoso.Native.dll` could be deduplicated into a single `lib/net8.0/Contoso.Native.dll` file, this is not recommended because NuGet will believe this package is compatible with projects using `packages.config`, and these projects will fail at runtime when the native `contoso.dll` is not found.

### Example 2

If `Contoso.Native` has any differences between architectures.
For example, but not limited to, using `#if` to compile difference code for different RIDs, or using `<PlatformTarget>` (or anything else that causes `-platform:` to be passed to the compiler) with a value other than `AnyCPU`.

```text
Contoso.Native.1.0.0.nuspec
ref/net8.0/Contoso.Native.dll
runtimes/linux-arm64/lib/net8.0/Contoso.Native.dll
runtimes/linux-arm64/native/libcontoso.so
runtimes/linux-x64/lib/net8.0/Contoso.Native.dll
runtimes/linux-x64/native/libcontoso.so
runtimes/osx-arm64/lib/net8.0/Contoso.Native.dll
runtimes/osx-arm64/native/libcontoso.dylib
runtimes/osx-x64/lib/net8.0/Contoso.Native.dll
runtimes/osx-x64/native/libcontoso.dylib
runtimes/win-arm64/lib/net8.0/Contoso.Native.dll
runtimes/win-arm64/native/contoso.dll
runtimes/win-x64/lib/net8.0/Contoso.Native.dll
runtimes/win-x64/native/contoso.dll
```

### Example 3

If `Contoso.Native` has conditional compilation per operating system, but not per CPU architecture.

```text
Contoso.Native.1.0.0.nuspec
ref/net8.0/Contoso.Native.dll
runtimes/linux/lib/net8.0/Contoso.Native.dll
runtimes/linux-arm64/native/libcontoso.so
runtimes/linux-x64/native/libcontoso.so
runtimes/osx/lib/net8.0/Contoso.Native.dll
runtimes/osx-arm64/native/libcontoso.dylib
runtimes/osx-x64/native/libcontoso.dylib
runtimes/win/lib/net8.0/Contoso.Native.dll
runtimes/win-arm64/native/contoso.dll
runtimes/win-x64/native/contoso.dll
```

## Projects Targeting .NET Framework

.NET has evolved over time, causing project and package incompatibility when certain features are used.
What was described above assumes that the project using the package targets .NET 5 or higher, or .NET Core (`netcoreapp`), which uses the maximum features to simplify the package contents as much as possible.
Projects targeting .NET Standard are not particularly relevant to this document, as those projects can only be class libraries, which cannot be run directly.
However, projects targeting .NET Framework can use either SDK style or non-SDK style projects, and non-SDK style projects may use either `PackageReference` or `packages.config` to use NuGet packages.
All of these combinations have different levels of support, and impose constraints on package authors who wish to support .NET Framework projects using the package.

Our recommendation is to split the package into 3 packages.
The first is a meta-package (a package with no contents/assets, only dependencies to other packages), that has dependencies to one of the other two packages, depending on target framework.
The second package contains the .NET 5+ `ref/*` and `runtimes/*` assets as described above.
The last package will contain the .NET Framework assets, and will not use the `ref/*` or `runtime/*` conventions.
This is due to the build system having (partial) support for these NuGet conventions, but the runtime working sufficiently differently that it's easier to avoid it, to maximize project compatibility.

The package with .NET Framework native libraries should have custom [MSBuild targets and props files](../concepts/MSBuild-props-and-targets.md), under `buildTransitive/<tfm>/<package ID>.[props|targets]`.
For example, `buildTransitive/net472/Contoso.Native.targets`.
To support `packages.config` projects, also have a `build/<tfm>/<package ID>.[props|targets]` which imports the `buildTransitive` file.
This MSBuild script should copy the native library to subdirectories.
Alternatively, the native libraries should have different filenames per CPU architecture, so they can all be copied into the same directory.

Finally, the managed library, that uses P/Invoke to call into the native library, it should have runtime checks to determine what platform the current executable is running in (x86, x64, or ARM64), and then P/Invoke into the native library with the correct filename or in the correct subdirectory.

### SDK style projects targeting .NET Framework

When the .NET SDK builds a project targeting the .NET Framework, if one of `RuntimeIdentifier` or `PlatformTarget` is set, the .NET SDK will set the other property to an appropriate value, and package `runtimes/<rid>` contents (that [follow NuGet's conventions](#understanding-nuget-package-asset-selection)) will be copied to the output directory.
If the the project does not set either `RuntimeIdentifier` or `PlatformTarget`, but any package contains RID specific contents, then the .NET SDK will set `PlatformTarget` to `x86`.
Therefore, SDK style projects targeting .NET Framework will only use `AnyCPU` by default when none of the packages contain RID specific content.

`dotnet build -r <rid>`, or the `publish` equivalent (for example, `dotnet publish -r win-arm64`) can be used to explicitly build or publish for a specific platform.

In order to support `AnyCPU` projects, package authors must not use the `runtimes/` conventions in their package, and must use the MSBuild targets/props files [as suggested above](#projects-targeting-net-framework).

### Non-SDK style projects targeting .NET Framework with `PackageReference`

If you test a non-SDK style `PackageReference` project with a package using the `runtimes/*` convention, the following behavior occurs.
If the project's configuration targets the "Any CPU" platform, the build will not copy any of the RID specific assets from the package, and the app will fail at runtime.
Using Visual Studio's Configuration Manager, the .NET projects can be changed to target x64, x86, or ARM64, instead of "Any CPU", in which case the app will work correctly at runtime.

In order to support `AnyCPU` projects, package authors must use the MSBuild targets/props files [as suggested above](#projects-targeting-net-framework).

### `packages.config`

NuGet's original restore style, `packages.config`, does not support `ref/*` or `runtimes/*` conventions.
Therefore, package authors must create their own MSBuild props and targets file to support projects still using `packages.config`.
