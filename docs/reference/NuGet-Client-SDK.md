# NuGet Client SDK

The NuGet v3 Client and NuGetGallery APIs are constantly evolving and we are working on having a stable surface area that we can document soon.

In the meantime, you can find examples and documentation for some of the API in the following blog series by Dave Glick:

- [Exploring the NuGet v3 Libraries, Part 1: Introduction and concepts](http://daveaglick.com/posts/exploring-the-nuget-v3-libraries-part-1)
- [Exploring the NuGet v3 Libraries, Part 2: Searching for packages](http://daveaglick.com/posts/exploring-the-nuget-v3-libraries-part-2)
- [Exploring the NuGet v3 Libraries, Part 3: Installing packages](http://daveaglick.com/posts/exploring-the-nuget-v3-libraries-part-3)

> [!Note]
> These blog posts were written shortly after the **3.4.3** version of the NuGet client SDK packages were released.
> Newer versions of the packages may be incompatible with the information in the blog posts.
