# NuGet Client SDK

> [!Note]
> Not to be confused with the [NuGet *Web* API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/api/overview)

The *NuGet Client SDK* refers to a group of .NET libraries centered around [NuGet.Client](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NuGet.Client), [Nuget.Packaging](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NuGet.Packaging), and [NuGet.Protocol](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NuGet.Protocol). These packages replace the earlier [NuGet.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NuGet.Core/) library.

We are working on having a stable surface area that we can document soon.

## Source code

The source code is published on GitHub in the project [NuGet/NuGet.Client](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client).

## Third-party documentation

You can find examples and documentation for some of the API in the following blog series by Dave Glick, published 2016:

> Newer versions of the packages may be incompatible with the information in the blog posts.
