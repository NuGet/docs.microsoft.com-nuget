# setapikey command (NuGet CLI)

**Applies to:** publishing &bullet; **Supported versions:** all

Saves an API key for a given server URL into `NuGet.Config` so that it doesn't need to be entered for subsequent push commands.

## Usage

```cli
nuget setapikey <key> -Source <url> [options]
```

where `<source>` identifies the server and `<key>` is the key to save. If `<source>` is omitted, nuget.org is assumed. 

> [!NOTE]
> API key is not used for authenticating with the private feed.
> Refer to [`nuget sources` command](../cli-reference/cli-ref-sources.md) to manage credentials for authenticating with the source.
> API keys can be obtained from the individual NuGet servers.
> To create and manage APIKeys for nuget.org refer to [acquire-an-api-key](../../nuget-org/scoped-api-keys.md#acquire-an-api-key).
