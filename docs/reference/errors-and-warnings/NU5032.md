# NuGet Error NU5032
> The license expression 'MIT OR OR Apache-2.0' cannot be parsed succesfully. The license expression is invalid.

### Issue

The license expression does not conform to the NuGet license expression grammar.

### Solution

In this case there are 2 'OR' operators. The operators have to be surrounded with operands. 
For example:

```
MIT OR Apache-2.0
```
