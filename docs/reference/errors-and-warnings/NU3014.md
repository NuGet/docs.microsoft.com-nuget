## Scenario 2

> Package 'SamplePackage v1.0.0' from source 'https://contoso.com/index.json': The primary signature's certificate does not meet a minimum public key length requirement.

> [!Note]
> When NuGet’s [signature validation mode](../../consume-packages/installing-signed-packages.md#configure-package-signature-requirements) is set to accept (default), NU3014 is raised as a warning. 
> When NuGet’s signature validation mode is set to require, or when running the `nuget verify -signatures` command, NU3014 is elevated from a warning to an error.
