# NuGet Error NU5039

<pre>The readme file 'readme.md' does not exist in the package.</pre>


### Issue

NuGet is unable to find the readme file in the package.


### Solution

- Make sure that the file that is marked as the package readme exists at the source and it is readable, and the target matches the path expected by the `readme` property.
- Ensure that the file is referenced in the nuspec or in the project file.
  * When creating a package from an MSBuild project file, make sure to reference the readme file in the project, as follows:

    ```xml
    <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
      <PropertyGroup>
          ...
          <PackageReadmeFile>readme.md</PackageReadmeFile>
          ...
      </PropertyGroup>

      <ItemGroup>
          ...
          <None Include="docs\readme.md" Pack="true" PackagePath=""/>
          ...
      </ItemGroup>
    </Project>
    ```

  * When you are creating a package from a nuspec file, make sure to include the readme file in the `<files/>` section:

    ```xml
    <package>
      <metadata>
        ...
        <readme>docs\readme.md</readme>
        ...
      </metadata>
      <files>
        ...
        <file src="..\readme.md" target="docs\" />
        ...
      </files>
    </package>
    ```
