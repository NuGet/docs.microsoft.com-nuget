# NuGet Warning NU3022

## Scenario 1

> Package 'SamplePackage v1.0.0' from source 'https://contoso.com/index.json': The primary signature's timestamp certificate has an unsupported signature algorithm.

### Issue

The certificate used to timestamp the package signature has an unsupported signature algorithm.


### Solution

Please ensure that the timestamp authority's signing certificate has one of the following signature algorithms - 
* `sha256WithRSAEncryption`
* `sha384WithRSAEncryption`
* `sha512WithRSAEncryption`



## Scenario 2

> Package 'SamplePackage v1.0.0' from source 'https://contoso.com/index.json': The timestamp certificate has an unsupported signature algorithm (SHA1). The following algorithms are supported: SHA256RSA, SHA384RSA, SHA512RSA.

### Issue

The certificate used to timestamp the package signature has an unsupported signature algorithm.


### Solution

Please request the package author to re-sign the package using the `nuget sign` command as described in [NuGet docs](../../create-packages/sign-a-package.md) using the `-Timestamper` option such that the timestamp authority signing certificate has one of the following signature algorithms -
* `sha256WithRSAEncryption`
* `sha384WithRSAEncryption`
* `sha512WithRSAEncryption`


> [!Note]
> When running the `nuget verify -signatures` command, NU3022 is raised as an error. Otherwise, NU3022 is raised as a warning.
