# NuGet Warning NU3022

## Scenario 1

<pre>Package 'SamplePackage v1.0.0' from source 'http://source.com/index.json': The primary signature's timestamp certificate has an unsupported signature algorithm.</pre>

### Issue

The certificate used to timestamp the package signature has an unsupported signature algorithm.


### Solution

Please ensure that the Timstamp Authority's signing certificate has one of the following signature algorithms - 
* `sha256WithRSAEncryption`
* `sha384WithRSAEncryption`
* `sha512WithRSAEncryption`



## Scenario 2

<pre>Package 'SamplePackage v1.0.0' from source 'http://source.com/index.json': The timestamp certificate has an unsupported signature algorithm (SHA1). The following algorithms are supported: SHA256RSA, SHA384RSA, SHA512RSA.</pre>

### Issue

The certificate used to timestamp the package signature has an unsupported signature algorithm.


### Solution

Please request the package author to resign the package using the `nuget sign` command as described in [NuGet docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/create-packages/sign-a-package) using the `-Timestamper` option such that the Timestamp Authority signing certificate has one of the following signature algorithms -
* `sha256WithRSAEncryption`
* `sha384WithRSAEncryption`
* `sha512WithRSAEncryption`
