# NuGet Error NU1103

## Scenario 1 

<pre>Unable to find a stable package 'PackageId' with version (>= 3.0.0)<br/>  - Found 10 version(s) in 'sourceA' [ Nearest version: '4.0.0-rc-2129' ]<br/>  - Found 9 version(s) in 'sourceB' [ Nearest version: '3.0.0-beta-00032' ]<br/>  - Found 0 version(s) in 'sourceC'<br/>  - Found 0 version(s) in 'sourceD'</pre>

### Issue
The project specified a stable version for the dependency range, but no stable versions were found in that range. Pre-release versions were found but are not allowed.

### Solution
Edit the version range in the project file to include pre-release versions. See [Package versioning](../../concepts/package-versioning.md).

## Scenario 2

<pre>Unable to find a stable package 'PackageId' with version (>= 3.0.0)<br/>  - Found 10 version(s) in 'sourceA' [ Nearest version: '4.0.0-rc-2129' ]<br/>  - Versions from sourceB were not considered</pre>

### Issue
The project specified a stable version for the dependency range, but no stable versions were found in that range. Pre-release versions were found but are not allowed.

### Solution
Edit the version range in the project file to include pre-release versions. See [Package versioning](../../concepts/package-versioning.md).
Check your [NuGet.Config](../../consume-packages/Configuring-NuGet-Behavior.md) for the [PackageSourceMapping](../../consume-packages/Package-Source-Mapping.md) configuration. The package version in question may be available on a source that is not configured.
