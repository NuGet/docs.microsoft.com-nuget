# NuGet Warning NU1204

<pre>Invalid tools package Contoso.Tool 1.0.0. Tools packages cannot contain more than one PackageType.</pre>

### Issue

The Contoso.Tool package has more than one package type. [DotnetTool](../../create-packages/set-package-type.md#known-package-types packages can only contain one PackageType.
