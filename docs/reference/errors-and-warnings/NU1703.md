# NuGet Warning NU1703

> 'packageId' was resolved as a dependency of 'project', but the dependency is using 'Xamarin.iOS' while 'project' is using 'net6.0-maccatalyst14.5' as its TargetFramework

### Issue

While `net6.0-maccatalyst` (and higher .NET versions) support using Xamarin.iOS dependencies, this is not guaranteed to be 100% compatible.

### Solution

Use a dependency that ships artifacts for `net6.0-maccatalyst` or a higher .NET version instead of relying on legacy Xamarin.iOS.
