# NuGet Warning NU5127

<pre>This package does not contain a lib/ or ref/ folder, and will therefore be treated as compatible for all frameworks. Since framework specific files were found under the build/ directory for net45, netstandard2.0, consider creating the following empty files to correctly narrow the compatibility of the package:
-lib/net45/_._
-lib/netstandard2.0/_._</pre>

### Issue

Projects using packages with `PackageReference` only use `lib/` and `ref/` assemblies to determine package compatibility. Therefore, a package without any `lib/` or `ref/` files will be considered compatible with all projects. However, if that package contains build files specific to one or more [Target Framework Monikers (TFMs)](../target-frameworks.md), a package consumer may expect the package to fail if none of the build files are used.

### Solution

As the warning message suggests, create an empty file named `_._` in the lib folder for the TFMs listed. This will allow NuGet to fail the restore for `PackageReference` projects when the project is incompatible with the package.
