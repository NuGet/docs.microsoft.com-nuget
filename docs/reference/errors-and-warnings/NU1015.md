# NuGet Error NU1015

## Scenario

> The following PackageReference item(s) do not have a version specified: Contoso.Utilities

### Issue

Your project file, or a file it imports (for example `Directory.Build.props`) has defined a `PackageReference` without a version.

Projects using [Central Package Management (CPM)](../../consume-packages/Central-Package-Management.md) must not define a version, so this error could happen if a project has CPM disabled by accident, or if a project or `PackageReference` using CPM is copied into another solution that is not using CPM.

### Solution

- Add a version to the package reference

If you edit your project, a package reference will generally look similar to `<PackageReference Include="Contoso.Utilities" Version="1.2.3" />`, although [MSBuild allows multiple syntaxes to define item metadata](/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild-items).
Add the `Version="1.2.3"` item metadata is defined.

- Check Central Package Management configuration

This NU1015 error only happens when CPM is disabled.
If Central Package Management (CPM) is intended to be enabled, check your configuration files to investigate why it is disabled.
