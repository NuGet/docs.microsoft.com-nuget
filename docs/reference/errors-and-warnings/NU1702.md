# NuGet Warning NU1702

<pre>ProjectReference 'C:\Code\Project2.csproj' was resolved using '.NETFramework,Version=v4.7.2' instead of the project target framework '.NETCoreApp,Version=v5.0'.
This project may not be fully compatible with your project.
</pre>

### Issue

`AssetTargetFallback` was used to select assets from a package. The warning lets users know that the assets may not be 100% compatible.

### Solution

Change the target framework to one of the projects to make them fully compatible.
