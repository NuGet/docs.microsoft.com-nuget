# NuGet Warning NU1702

> ProjectReference 'C:\Code\Project2.csproj' was resolved using '.NETFramework,Version=v4.7.2' instead of the project target framework '.NETCoreApp,Version=v5.0'.
> This project may not be fully compatible with your project.

### Issue

`AssetTargetFallback` was used to select assets from a package. The warning lets users know that the assets may not be 100% compatible.

### Solution

Change the target framework of the projects to make them fully compatible.
Example: Change the target framework of Project2 to `.NET 5`, or change Project2 to target both `.NET 5` and `.NET Framework 4.7.2`.
