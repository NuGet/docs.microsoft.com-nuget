> Package 'SamplePackage v1.0.0' from source 'https://contoso.com/index.json': The signing certificate has an unsupported signature algorithm.

### Issue

The certificate used to sign the package has an unsupported signature algorithm.


### Solution

Please ensure that the signing certificate has one of the following signature algorithms - 
* `sha256WithRSAEncryption`
* `sha384WithRSAEncryption`
* `sha512WithRSAEncryption`



## Scenario 2

> Package 'SamplePackage v1.0.0' from source 'https://contoso.com/index.json': The primary signature's certificate has an unsupported signature algorithm.

### Issue

### Solution

Please ensure that the package was signed using a certificate with one of the following signature algorithms - 
* `sha256WithRSAEncryption`
* `sha384WithRSAEncryption`
* `sha512WithRSAEncryption`


> [!Note]
> When NuGet’s [signature validation mode](../../consume-packages/installing-signed-packages.md#configure-package-signature-requirements) is set to accept (default), NU3013 is raised as a warning. 
> When NuGet’s signature validation mode is set to require, or when running the `nuget verify -signatures` command, NU3013 is elevated from a warning to an error.
