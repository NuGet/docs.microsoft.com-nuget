# NuGet Error NU1011

<pre>Centrally defined floating package versions are not allowed.</pre>

### Issue

`<PackageVersion />` items cannot contain floating versions.  NuGet's central package management (CPM) is considered an enterprise-level feature which provides easier version
management at scale as well as deterministic and secure restores.  The use of floating versions introduces the possibility for a bad package to be introduced into your build
after it has been pushed to a feed.  This can lead to a situation where you made no changes in your repository but suddenly something is broken and there is no way for you to
get back into a good state without removing the floating version or pushing a newer version of the package which is fixed.  Using non-floating versions means that every upgrade
to a package is backed by a commit in your repository making it easy to determine what change caused the break and to revert a commit to get back into a good state.

Features of central package management like [Transitive Pinning](../../consume-packages/Central-Package-Management.md#transitive-pinning) is designed to allow you to explicitly override the transitive versions in your graph for more control. Using a floating version as an override would lead to very undeterministic restores.  [NuGet Lock Files](../../consume-packages/package-references-in-project-files.md#enabling-the-lock-file) are another enterprise-level feature that does not work well with floating versions since the lock files will be constantly need to be regenerated.

NuGet recommends you use automation like [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot) to keep package versions up-to-date which provides
a streamlined way of keeping packages updated while integrating into your existing developer workflow of a pull request, automated build validation, and testing all backed by a
commit in your repository.


### Solution

Change the floating version to a [non floating version range](../../concepts/Package-Versioning.md#version-ranges).
