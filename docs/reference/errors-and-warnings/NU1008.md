# NuGet Error NU1008

<pre>Projects that use central package version management should not define the version on the PackageReference items but on the PackageVersion items: PackageId.</pre>

### Issue

When using central package management, versions must be defined on the PackageVersion item.

In your project file, you may see:

```xml
<!-- In the project file. -->
<PackageReference Include="PackageId" Version="5.1.0" />
```

### Solution

- Remove the version from the PackageId PackageReference.
- You may need to add or update the PackageVersion item for PackageId in Directory.Packages.props

Example:

```xml
<!-- In the project file. -->
<PackageReference Include="PackageId" />
```

```xml
<!-- In the project file -->
<PackageVersion Include="PackageId" Version="5.1.0" />
```

> [!NOTE]
> Note that metadata such as [IncludeAssets, PrivateAssets etc.](../../consume-packages/Package-References-in-Project-Files.md#controlling-dependency-assets) should remain on the PackageReference item.
