# NuGet Warning NU1802

### Issue

Updating last access time on file "C:\packages\contoso.library\1.0.0\.nupkg.metadata" failed with _various failure reasons_

### Solution

You have enabled an experimental feature that updates the last access of the .nupkg.metadata file in the NuGet global packages folder. 
Failures are likely to be issues with permissions.
The details of the failure reason will be contained in the error message. Consult that information for the exact action.
