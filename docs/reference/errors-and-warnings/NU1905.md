# NuGet Warning NU1905

```text
warning NU1905: NuGetAudit is enabled, but no package sources contain known vulnerability data.
```

### Issue

`NuGetAudit` is explicitly enabled, but none of the configured package sources provide vulnerability information for NuGet to check against.

### Solution

NuGet asks all configured package sources for vulnerability information.
Any package source implementing [NuGet's V3 server API can provide the data via the VulnerabilityInfo resource](../../api/vulnerability-info.md), including by mirroring nuget.org's vulnerability data.
You can check if your package source administrators have a setting to enable vulnerability data.

> [!NOTE]
> There is [a request to get vulnerability data without adding nuget.org as a package source](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/12698).
> As a temporary mitigation, if your security policy allows it, you can use [Package Source Mapping](../../consume-packages/Package-Source-Mapping.md) to get all your packages from package sources other than nuget.org, so that adding nuget.org as a package source will only use it for vulnerability data.

For more information, see [the documentation on auditing packages](../../concepts/Auditing-Packages.md).
