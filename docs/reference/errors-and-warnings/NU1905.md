# NuGet Warning NU1905

```text
warning NU1905: Audit source 'Contoso' did not provide any vulnerability data.
```

### Issue

A source specified in a [NuGet.Config `<auditSources>` element](../nuget-config-file.md#auditsources) did not provide a vulnerability database.

### Solution

Any NuGet source implementing [NuGet's V3 server API can provide vulnerability data via the `VulnerabilityInfo` resource](../../api/vulnerability-info.md), including by mirroring nuget.org's vulnerability data.
Any source defined in a NuGet.Config `<auditSources>` element is expected to provide this resource, and this warning is raised when it is not.
You can check if your package source administrators have a setting to enable vulnerability data.

If you would like to treat this warning as an error, to cause build failures when vulnerability checks could not be performed, you can add `<WarningAsError>$(WarningAsError);NU1905</WarningAsError>` to your project file.
If you are using `TreatWarningsAsErrors` to cause all warnings to be treated as errors, you can add `<NoWarn>$(NoWarn);NU1905</NoWarn>` to your project file to suppress this warning message, or `<WarningsNotAsErrors>NU1905</WarningsNotAsErrors>` to prevent this warning from being treated as an error.

For more information, see [the documentation on auditing packages](../../concepts/Auditing-Packages.md).
