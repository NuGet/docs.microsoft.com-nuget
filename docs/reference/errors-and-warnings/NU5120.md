# NuGet Warning NU5120
<pre>install.ps1 script will be ignored when the package is installed after the migration.</pre>

### Issue

The package contains an `install.ps1` file. The file will not be executed if the package is installed to a package reference type of project.


### Solution

Please request the package author to fix the package such that it no longer contains an `install.ps1` file. You can read more about it in [NuGet docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/migrate-packages-config-to-package-reference).
