# NuGet Warning NU5131

<pre>References were found in the nuspec, but some reference assemblies were not found in both the nuspec and ref folder. Add the following reference assemblies:
- Add AssemblyName.dll to the ref/net472/ directory</pre>

### Issue

NuGet has a feature to allow package authors to [select which assemblies will be available at compile time](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/nuget/create-packages/select-assemblies-referenced-by-projects) in projects that use the package.

If the required conventions are not followed, projects using the package with `PackageReference` may fail at runtime due to missing assemblies.

### Solution

The list of assemblies in the nuspec file's `<references>` section should have matching assemblies in `ref/<tfm>/`.

For example, consider a package with the following files:

```text
lib\net472\MyLib.dll
lib\net472\MyHelpers.dll
lib\net472\MyUtilities.dll
```

The package author wants to prevent package consumers from writing code that directly calls `MyUtilities.dll`, so they add the following to their nuspec file:

```xml
<references>
    <group targetFramework="net472">
        <reference file="MyLib.dll" />
        <reference file="MyHelpers.dll" />
    </group>
</references>
```

This works for projects using the package with `packages.config`, but to work as intended with `ProjectReference`, the project must also contain the following files:

```text
ref\net472\MyLib.dll
ref\net472\MyHelpers.dll
```
