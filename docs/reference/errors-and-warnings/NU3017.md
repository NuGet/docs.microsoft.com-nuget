# NuGet Warning NU3017

## Scenario 1

> Package 'SamplePackage v1.0.0' from source 'https://contoso.com/index.json': The signing certificate is not yet valid.

### Issue

The certificate used to sign the package has a validity in the future, but is not valid currently.


### Solution

Please ensure that the signing certificate is currently valid.



## Scenario 2

> Package 'SamplePackage v1.0.0' from source 'https://contoso.com/index.json': The primary signature's certificate is not yet valid.

### Issue

The certificate used to sign the package has a validity in the future, but is not valid currently.


### Solution

Please request the package author to re-sign the package using the `nuget sign` command as described in [NuGet docs](../../create-packages/sign-a-package.md) with a signing certificate which is currently valid.


> [!Note]
> When NuGet’s [signature validation mode](../../consume-packages/installing-signed-packages.md#configure-package-signature-requirements) is set to accept (default), NU3017 is raised as a warning. 
> When NuGet’s signature validation mode is set to require, or when running the `nuget verify -signatures` command, NU3017 is elevated from a warning to an error.
