# NuGet Error NU3028

## Scenario 1

<pre>Package 'SamplePackage v1.0.0' from source 'http://source.com/index.json': Certificate chain validation failed.</pre>

### Issue

The Timestamp Authority's signing certificate chain validation failed due to one of the following reasons - 
* The timestamp certificate has been revoked.
* The timestamp certificate chain terminated in an untrusted root certificate.


### Solution

Please resign the package using the `nuget sign` command as described in [NuGet docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/create-packages/sign-a-package) using the `-Timestamper` option such that the Timestamp Authority signing certificate is not revoked. 
Further, please ensure that the Timestamp Authority signing certificate's root issuing certificate is trusted on your machine. 



## Scenario 2

<pre>Package 'SamplePackage v1.0.0' from source 'http://source.com/index.json': The primary signature's timestamp found a chain building issue: A certificate chain processed, but terminated in a root certificate which is not trusted by the trust provider.</pre>

### Issue

NuGet client tried to verify a package signature timestamp for which certificate chain validation failed due to one of the following reasons - 
* The timestamp certificate has been revoked.
* The timestamp certificate chain terminated in an untrusted root certificate.


### Solution

Please request the package author to resign the package using the `nuget sign` command as described in [NuGet docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/create-packages/sign-a-package) using the `-Timestamper` option such that the Timestamp Authority signing certificate is not revoked. 
Further, please ensure that the Timestamp Authority signing certificate's root issuing certificate is trusted on your machine.
