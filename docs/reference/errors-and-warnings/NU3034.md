# NuGet Error NU3034

<pre>Package 'SamplePackage v1.0.0' from source 'https://contoso.com/index.json': signatureValidationMode is set to require, so packages are allowed only if signed by trusted signers; however, no trusted signers were specified.</pre>
<pre>Package 'SamplePackage v1.0.0' from source 'https://contoso.com/index.json': The package signature certificate fingerprint does not match any certificate fingerprint in the allow list.</pre>
<pre>Package 'SamplePackage v1.0.0' from source 'https://contoso.com/index.json': This repository indicated that all its packages are repository signed; however, it listed no signing certificates.</pre>
<pre>Package 'SamplePackage v1.0.0' from source 'https://contoso.com/index.json': This package was not repository signed with a certificate listed by this repository.</pre>

### Issue

There is a missing allow list, or the package signer does not match any signer in the list. This list could either be sent by the repository or specified in the [`trustedSigners`](../nuget-config-file.md#trustedsigners-section) section of the `nuget.config`.

### Solution

If in `require` mode, only packages signed by a trusted signer will pass validation. Otherwise, contact the repository where this was downloaded from to let them know they have a package that does not comply with the repository signing security guidelines.
