# NuGet Error NU1202

<pre>Package 'PackageId' 4.0.11 is not compatible with 'TargetFramework'. Package 'PackageId' 4.0.11 supports:<br/>  - 'TargetFrameworkA'<br/>  - 'TargetFrameworkB'<br/>  - 'TargetFrameworkC'</pre>

### Issue
A dependency package doesn't contain any assets compatible with the project.

### Solution
- Change the project's target framework to one that the package supports.
- Give our new experimental one-click tool, [NuGetSolver](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/nuget/introducing-nugetsolver-a-powerful-tool-for-resolving-nuget-dependency-conflicts-in-visual-studio/), a try. This tool can automatically fix this problem if youâ€™re using VS2022 with nuget.org. Please provide us with feedback. Based on the feedback received, we will decide whether to officially support this new tool and incorporate it into the NuGet package manager.
