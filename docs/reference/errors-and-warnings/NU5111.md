# NuGet Warning NU5111
<pre>The script file 'tools\random.ps1' is not recognized by NuGet and hence will not be executed during installation of this package. Rename it to install.ps1, uninstall.ps1 or init.ps1 and place it directly under 'tools'.</pre>

### Issue

An unrecognized `.ps1` file was detected being packaged.


### Solution

Please rename the file to ` init.ps1` and place it directly under `tools` folder for it to be compatible with NuGet tooling.
