# NuGet Error NU1012

<pre>Some dependency group TFMs are missing a platform version: net6.0-android</pre>

### Issue

When creating a package for a framework with a platform such as `android`, you need to specify the correct platform version.

### Solution

Specify the platform version in your nuspec.
If you are using the pack targets, the platform version will be automatically inferred.
