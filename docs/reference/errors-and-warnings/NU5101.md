# NuGet Warning NU5101

## Scenario 1
<pre>The assembly 'lib\project.dll' is placed directly under 'lib' folder. It is recommended that assemblies be placed inside a framework-specific folder. Move it into a framework-specific folder.</pre>

### Issue

The folder being packaged contains an assembly file that is directly under a `lib` folder.


### Solution

While packaging a folder please ensure that all assembly files are placed inside a framework-specific folder under a `lib` folder.


## Scenario 2
<pre>The assembly 'lib\project.dll' will be ignored when the package is installed after the migration.</pre>

### Issue

The package contains an assembly file that is directly under a `lib` folder. The package will not be compatible with a package reference type of project.


### Solution

Please request the package author to fix the package such that all assemblies are placed inside a framework-specific folder under a `lib` folder. You can read more about it in [NuGet docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/migrate-packages-config-to-package-reference).
