# NuGet Error NU1104

> Project reference does not exist 'ProjectFile'. Check that the project reference is valid and that the project file exists.

### Issue
A ProjectReference points to a file that doesn't exist.

### Solution
Edit the project file to either correct the path to the referenced project or to remove the reference altogether if it's no longer needed.
