# NuGet Warning NU1803

### Issue

You are running the 'restore' operation with an 'HTTP' source, 'http://api.source/index.json'. Non-HTTPS access will be removed in a future version. Consider migrating to an 'HTTPS' source.

### Solution

You may need to do one of the following:

- Correct the specified url. You may have mistyped the source url. Change the url to explicitly request the `HTTPS` version of the source.
- Work with the owner of the source and ask them to migrate to `HTTPS`.
