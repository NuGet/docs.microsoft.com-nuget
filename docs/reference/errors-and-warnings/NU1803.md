# NuGet Warning NU1803

### Issue

You are running the 'restore' operation with an 'HTTP' source, 'http://api.source/index.json'. Non-HTTPS access will be removed in a future version. Consider migrating to an 'HTTPS' source.

### Solution

You may need to do one of the following:

- Correct the specified url. You may have mistyped the source url. Change the url to explicitly request the `HTTPS` version of the source.
- Work with the owner of the source and ask them to migrate to `HTTPS`.
- If you are absolutely certain the 'HTTP' server you are connecting to is trustworthy, you may opt out of this warning by setting `allowInsecureConnections` to `true` for this package source, in [Package source sections](..\nuget-config-file.md#package-source-sections) of your NuGet.Config file. (Supported in NuGet 6.8+)

**Example**:

```xml
<packageSources>
    <clear />    
    <add key="http-source1" value="http://httpsource1trusted/" allowInsecureConnections="true">
    <add key="http-source2" value="http://httpsource2trusted/" protocolVersion="3" allowInsecureConnections="true">
</packageSources>
```
