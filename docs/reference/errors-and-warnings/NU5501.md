# NuGet Warning NU5501

### Issue

Packaged folders must include dots in their framework version numbers. This is required as of .NET 5.0.

This issue generally occurs when manually adding items to a package, using something like the following in your `.csproj`:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <None Include="my.dll" Pack="true" PackagePath="lib/net50" />
</ItemGroup>
```

### Solution

Make sure to use dots in your version numbers during pack, for example, turn the above into:


```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <None Include="my.dll" Pack="true" PackagePath="lib/net5.0" />
</ItemGroup>
```
