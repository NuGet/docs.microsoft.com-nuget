# NuGet Warning NU3025

## Scenario 1

<pre>Package 'SamplePackage v1.0.0' from source 'http://source.com/index.json': The timestamp signing certificate is not yet valid.</pre>

### Issue

The certificate used to timestamp the package signature has a validity in the future, but is not valid currently.


### Solution

Please ensure that the Timestamp Authority's signing certificate is currently valid. If the problem persists, contact the Timestamp Authority to discover the source of the problem.



## Scenario 2

<pre>Package 'SamplePackage v1.0.0' from source 'http://source.com/index.json': The primary signature's timestamp signing certificate is not yet valid.</pre>

### Issue

The certificate used to sign the package has a validity in the future, but is not valid currently.


### Solution

Please request the package author to resign the package using the `nuget sign` command as described in [NuGet docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/create-packages/sign-a-package). If the problem persists, request the package author to contact the Timestamp Authority to discover the source of the problem.
