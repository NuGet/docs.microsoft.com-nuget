# NuGet Warning NU3025

## Scenario 1

> Package 'SamplePackage v1.0.0' from source 'https://contoso.com/index.json': The timestamp signing certificate is not yet valid.

### Issue

The certificate used to timestamp the package signature has a validity in the future, but is not valid currently.


### Solution

Please ensure that the Timestamp Authority's signing certificate is currently valid. If the problem persists, contact the Timestamp Authority to discover the source of the problem.



## Scenario 2

> Package 'SamplePackage v1.0.0' from source 'https://contoso.com/index.json': The primary signature's timestamp signing certificate is not yet valid.

### Issue

The certificate used to sign the package has a validity in the future, but is not valid currently.


### Solution

Please request the package author to re-sign the package using the `nuget sign` command as described in [NuGet docs](../../create-packages/sign-a-package.md). If the problem persists, request the package author to contact the Timestamp Authority to discover the source of the problem.


> [!Note]
> When running the `nuget verify -signatures` command, NU3025 is raised as an error. Otherwise, NU3025 is raised as a warning.
