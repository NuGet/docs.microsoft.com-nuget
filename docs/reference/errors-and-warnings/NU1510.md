# NuGet Warning NU1510

## Scenario 1

> PackageReference System.Text.Json 9.0.0 will not be pruned. Consider removing this package from your dependencies, as it is likely unnecessary.

### Issue

The package `System.Text.Json` has been specified for pruning through the [PrunePackageReference](../../consume-packages/Package-References-in-Project-Files.md#prunepackagereference) feature.
The `.NET SDK` generally specifies the list of packages to be pruned. The package is not needed as a direct PackageReference since the .NET runtime itself carries either the same or higher version of the assembly.

### Solution

Remove the PackageReference as it's unnecessary.
