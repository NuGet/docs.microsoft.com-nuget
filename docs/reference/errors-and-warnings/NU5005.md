# NuGet Error NU5005
> Ensure 'F:\project\project.nuspec' includes source and symbol files. For help on building symbols package, visit http://docs.nuget.org/.

### Issue

The NuGet pack operation was invoked with the `-Symbols` option, but the nuspec file does not contain any source or symbols files.


### Solution

When building a symbols package, ensure that the folder containing the nuspec file contains assembly files for which the symbols need to be packaged.
