# NuGet Error NU3008

> Package 'SamplePackage v1.0.0' from source 'https://contoso.com/index.json': The package integrity check failed. The package has changed since it was signed. Try clearing the local http-cache and run nuget operation again.

### Issue

NuGet package being verified has changed since it was signed.

### Solution

Please ensure that the package has not been tampered with since signing. If this was a temporary problem, then you can fix this by clearing your local http-cache(s) by running `nuget locals http-cache -clear` or `dotnet nuget locals http-cache --clear` command. However, if the problem persists then please inform the package source and the package author.

If this issue happened on a package which came from `nuget.org` then please file an issue at [NuGet/Home](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues) along with the package that caused this problem.
