# NuGet Error NU3008

<pre>Package 'SamplePackage v1.0.0' from source 'http://source.com/index.json': The package integrity check failed.</pre>

### Issue

NuGet package being verified has changed since it was signed.


### Solution

Please ensure that the package has not been tampered with since signing. If this was a temporary problem, then you can fix this by clearing your local cache(s) by running `nuget locals -Clear all` command. However, if the problem persists then please inform the package source and the package author.

If this issue happened on a package which came from `nuget.org` then please file an issue at [NuGet/Home](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues) along with the package that caused this problem.
