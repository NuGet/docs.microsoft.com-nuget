# NuGet Warning NU5107
<pre>The file 'tools/subfolder/init.ps1' will be ignored by NuGet because it is not directly under 'tools' folder. Place the file directly under 'tools' folder.</pre>

### Issue

An `init.ps1` file was detected in a folder under the `tools` folder.


### Solution

Please place the `init.ps1` file directly under the `tools` folder for it to be compatible with NuGet tooling.
