# NuGet Error NU1100

## Scenario 1

<pre>Unable to resolve 'Dependency (>= 1.0.0)' for 'TargetFramework'</pre>

### Issue
A dependency could not be resolved. This is a generic issue for types that are not packages or projects. 

This issue may also be caused by the lack of a NuGet configuration file.

### Solution
Open the project file and examine the list of its dependencies. Check that each dependency exists on the package sources you're using, and that the package supports the project's target framework.

In the case of a NuGet configuration file not being created, issue the following command from the root folder of the project:  
`dotnet new nugetconfig`

## Scenario 2

<pre> Unable to resolve 'Dependency (>= 1.0.0)' for 'TargetFramework'.  PackageSourceMapping is enabled, the following source(s) were not considered: nuget. </pre>

### Issue

A dependency could not be resolved. PackageSourceMapping is enabled and there are no matching sources.

### Solution

Check your [NuGet.Config](../../consume-packages/Configuring-NuGet-Behavior.md) for the [PackageSourceMapping](../../consume-packages/Package-Source-Mapping.md) configuration and ensure there's a matching pattern for the package in question.
