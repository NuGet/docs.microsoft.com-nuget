# NuGet Error NU5001
<pre>Unable to output resolved nuspec file because it would overwrite the original at 'F:\project\project.nuspec'.</pre>

### Issue

The NuGet pack operation was invoked with the `-InstallPackageToOutputPath` option, but the output path already contained a  nuspec file.


### Solution

Please ensure that the output path passed the to NuGet pack command does not already contain a nuspec file.
