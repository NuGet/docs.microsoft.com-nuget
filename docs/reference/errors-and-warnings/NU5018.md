# NuGet Error NU5018
<pre>Invalid assembly reference 'xunit.dll'. Ensure that a file named 'xunit.dll' exists in the lib directory.</pre>

### Issue

The nuspec file used to create the NuGet pack operation contained `references` that do not exist in the `.\lib` folder in the project directory.


### Solution

Please ensure that any referenced assemblies are placed inside `.\lib` folder which is in the same folder as the nuspec file used to create the package.
