# NuGet Error NU5007
<pre>No build found in F:\project\bin\Debug\net461\project.dll. Use the -Build option or build the project.</pre>

### Issue

The NuGet pack operation was invoked with the `-Symbols` option, but the project being packaged has not been built yet and hence cannot be packed.


### Solution

Please build the project before running NuGet pack operation or use the `-Build` option to build the project before packaging.
