# NuGet Warning NU5122
<pre>XDT transform file 'tools/transform.xdt' will not be applied when the package is installed after the migration.</pre>

### Issue

The package contains an assembly file that is not under a target framework specific folder. The package will not be compatible with a package reference type of project.


### Solution

Please request the package author to fix the package such that it no longer contains an `install.ps1` file. You can read more about it in [NuGet docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/migrate-packages-config-to-package-reference).
