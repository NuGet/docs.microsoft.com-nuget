# NuGet Warning NU3030

> Package 'SamplePackage v1.0.0' from source 'https://contoso.com/index.json': The primary signature's timestamp's message imprint uses an unsupported hash algorithm.

### Issue

The primary signature's timestamp's message imprint uses an unsupported hash algorithm.  


### Solution

Request the package author to re-sign the package using the `nuget sign` command as described in [NuGet docs](../../create-packages/sign-a-package.md) using the `-Timestamper` option such that the timestamp's message imprint uses one of the following hash algorithms -
* `SHA-2-256`
* `SHA-2-384`
* `SHA-2-512`


> [!Note]
> When running the `nuget verify -signatures` command, NU3030 is raised as an error. Otherwise, NU3030 is raised as a warning.
