# NuGet Warning NU3036

## Scenario 1

> Package 'SamplePackage v1.0.0' from source 'https://contoso.com/index.json': The timestamp's generalized time is outside the timestamping certificate's validity period.

### Issue

The timestamp's generalized time is outside the timestamping certificate's validity period.


### Solution

Try to re-sign and timestamp the package. If the problem persists, contact the timestamp authority to discover the source of the problem.



## Scenario 2

> Package 'SamplePackage v1.0.0' from source 'https://contoso.com/index.json': The primary signature's timestamp's generalized time is outside the timestamping certificate's validity period.

### Issue

The certificate used to timestamp the package signature is invalid as the timestamp's generalized time is outside the timestamping certificate's validity period.


### Solution

Request the package author to re-sign and timestamp the package using the `nuget sign` command as described in [NuGet docs](../../create-packages/sign-a-package.md). If the problem persists, request the package author to contact the timestamp authority to discover the source of the problem.


> [!Note]
> When running the `nuget verify -signatures` command, NU3036 is raised as an error. Otherwise, NU3036 is raised as a warning.
