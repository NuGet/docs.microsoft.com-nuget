# NuGet Warning NU1302

> You are running the 'restore' operation with an 'HTTP' source: myHttpSource. NuGet requires HTTPS sources. To use an HTTP source, you must explicitly set 'allowInsecureConnections' to true in your NuGet.Config file. Please refer to https://aka.ms/nuget-https-everywhere for more information.

### Issue

`myHttpSource` is an insecure HTTP source. We recommend using HTTPS sources instead.

### Solution

This can be fixed either by removing the HTTP source or disabling HTTP Errors for the specific source by using `allowInsecureConnections` option in your [NuGet config file](../../reference/nuget-config-file.md).
