# NuGet Warning NU5133

## Example

> Warning NU5133: NuGet.exe file on path \Downloads\nuget.exe needs to be unblocked after downloading.

### Issue
When downloading a file on Windows, in this case nuget.exe, through a web browser, the `Mark Of The Web` may be added.
This makes Windows consider that flag as potentially dangerous despite coming from a well known source such as nuget.org.
As a consequence some `nuget.exe pack` operations may work incorrectly.

### Solution 1
Right click on your downloaded copy of `nuget.exe` and select "Properties".

  ![NuGet Properties](../media/NuGetProperties.png)

Now tick the `Unblock` then press apply.

  ![NuGet Unblock](../media/NuGetUnblock.png)

Now try again the pack operation.

### Solution 2
From powershell terminal run `Unblock-File -Path .\Solution\nuget.exe`
