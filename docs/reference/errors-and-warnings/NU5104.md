# NuGet Warning NU5104
<pre>A stable release of a package should not have a prerelease dependency. Either modify the version spec of dependency "NuGet.Versioning [4.7.0-preview4.5065, )" or update the version field in the nuspec.</pre>

### Issue

The project or nuspec being packaged contains a dependency on a prerelease package.


### Solution

If you intend to create a prerelease package then please refer to SemVer2 guidelines and add a prerelease tag to the version property i.e. `<version>1.0.0-pre</version>`. If you intend to create a stable package then please update the specified dependency version to a stable version.
