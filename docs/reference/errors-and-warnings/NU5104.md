# NuGet Warning NU5104
<pre>A stable release of a package should not have a prerelease dependency. Either modify the version spec of dependency "NuGet.Versioning [4.7.0-preview4.5065, )" or update the version field in the nuspec.</pre>

### Issue

The project or nuspec being packaged contains a dependency on a prerelease package.


### Solution

If you intend to create a prerelease package then please refer to SemVer2 guidelines and add a prerelease tag to the version property i.e. `<version>1.0.0-pre</version>`. If you intend to create a stable package then please update the specified dependency version to a stable version.

> [!NOTE]
> Mixing stable and prerelease packages may lead to unexpected behaviors are resolution time. Learn more about how [PackageReference](../../concepts/Dependency-Resolution.md#version-ranges-and-prerelease-versions-with-packagereference) and [packages.config](../../concepts/Dependency-Resolution.md#version-ranges-and-prerelease-versions-with-packagesconfig) projects handle this resolution.
