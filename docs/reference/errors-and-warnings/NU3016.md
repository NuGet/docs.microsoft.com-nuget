# NuGet Warning NU3016

> Package 'SamplePackage v1.0.0' from source 'https://contoso.com/index.json': The package hash uses an unsupported hash algorithm.

### Issue

NuGet client tried to verify a package which was signed using an unsupported hash algorithm.


### Solution

Please ensure that the package was signed  with one of the following hash algorithms - 
* `sha256`
* `sha384`
* `sha512`


> [!Note]
> When NuGet’s [signature validation mode](../../consume-packages/installing-signed-packages.md#configure-package-signature-requirements) is set to accept (default), NU3016 is raised as a warning. 
> When NuGet’s signature validation mode is set to require, or when running the `nuget verify -signatures` command, NU3016 is elevated from a warning to an error.
