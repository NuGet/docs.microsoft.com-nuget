# NuGet Warning NU1605

## Example 1

<pre>Detected package downgrade: 'PackageB' from 4.0.0 to 3.5.0. Reference the package directly from the project to select a different version.<br/>  'PackageA' 3.5.0 -> 'PackageB' 3.5.0<br/>  'PackageC' 4.0.0 -> 'PackageD' 4.0.0 -> 'PackageB' 4.0.0</pre>

### Issue
A dependency package specified a version constraint on a higher version of a package than restore ultimately resolved. That is, because of the [`nearest-wins`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/dependency-resolution#nearest-wins) rule when resolving packages, a nearer package in the graph may have overridden a distant package.

### Solution
To the project exhibiting the restore error, add a package reference to the higher version of the package

In the example above, you would add a package reference to Package B version 4.0.0:

<pre>
  'PackageA' 3.5.0 -> 'PackageB' 3.5.0<br/>
  'PackageC' 4.0.0 -> 'PackageD' 4.0.0 -> 'PackageB' 4.0.0<br/>
  'PackageB' 4.0.0
</pre>

Since, [`nearest-wins`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/dependency-resolution#nearest-wins), the direct package reference to PackageB 4.0.0 (made at level 1), will take precedence over PackageB (made at level 2).

## Example 2

<pre>Detected package downgrade: Microsoft.NETCore.App from 2.1.8 to 2.1.0. Reference the package directly from the project to select a different version.<br/>
  test -> mvc -> Microsoft.NETCore.App (>= 2.1.8)<br/>
  test -> Microsoft.NETCore.App (>= 2.1.0)<br/>
</pre>

### Issue
The mvc project specified a version constraint on a higher version of a package than restore ultimately resolved. That is, because of the [`nearest-wins`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/dependency-resolution#nearest-wins) rule when resolving packages, a nearer package in the graph may have overridden a distant package.

### Solution
This specific error (with Microsoft.NETCore.App package) is improved by moving your .NET Core SDK to 2.2.100 or later. A related doc page about (Self-contained deployment runtime roll forward)[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/runtime-patch-selection] may help. Microsoft.NETCore.App is an auto-referenced package that the .NET Core SDK before version 3.0.100 chooses to bring in automatically.
