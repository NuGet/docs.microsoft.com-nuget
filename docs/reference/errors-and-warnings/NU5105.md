# NuGet Warning NU5105
<pre>The package version '1.2.3+semver2.metadata' uses SemVer 2.0.0 or components of SemVer 1.0.0 that are not supported on legacy clients. Change the package version to a SemVer 1.0.0 string. If the version contains a release label it must start with a letter. This message can be ignored if the package is not intended for older clients.</pre>

### Issue

The `version` property specified contains SemVer 2.0.0 components or SemVer 1.0.0 components that may not be supported on NuGet clients older than v4.3


### Solution

If you intend for your package to be available to NuGet clients older than v4.3 than please adapt the `version` property to be compatible with the legacy clients. You can read more about the SemVer 2.0.0 support [here](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/wiki/SemVer-2.0.0-support).
