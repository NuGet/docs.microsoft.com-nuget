# NuGet Error NU1110

<pre>NU1110: The package `B` is available in the Global packages folder, but the source it came from `https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json` is not one of the configured sources.
</pre>

### Issue

A previous restore retrieved package `B` from a package source which your current solution does not have configured.

While performing a package installation of package `A`, a dependent package `B` was needed transitively to complete the action. Restore found `B` in your [Global packages folder](../../consume-packages/managing-the-global-packages-and-cache-folders.md)), and the accompanying `nupkg.metadata` indicates a `Source` value which it cannot find in your solution.

When [package source mapping](../../consume-packages/Package-Source-Mapping.md) is enabled, NuGet attempts to map transitive dependencies automatically by analyzing the source in the Global packages folder.

### Solution

#### Option 1. 
Create a package source mapping for package `B`.

#### Option 2.
Clear package `B` from your Global packages folder so that restore can download from one of your configured packages sources. For more information, see [Managing the global packages, cache, and temp folders](../../consume-packages/managing-the-global-packages-and-cache-folders).

If your other solutions have different package sources and package source mapping configurations, this option may not be feasible.

#### Option 3.
Consider enabling a package source which you know has package `B` available.
