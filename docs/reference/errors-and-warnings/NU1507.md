# NuGet Warning NU1507

> There are 2 package sources defined in your configuration. When using central package management, please map your package sources with package source mapping or specify a single package source. The following sources are defined: https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json,  https://contoso.myget.org/F/development/.

## Issue

A project is configured to use NuGet [Central Package Management](../../consume-packages/Central-Package-Management.md) and is not configured to use [Package Source Mapping](../../consume-packages/Package-Source-Mapping.md).
It is highly recommended to enable [Package Source Mapping](../../consume-packages/Package-Source-Mapping.md) because it safeguards your software supply chain when your project is consuming packages from multiple package sources by allowing you specify the source for each package.

## Solution

- Onboard to [Package Source Mapping](../../consume-packages/Package-Source-Mapping.md) if you have more than one HTTP-based NuGet package source configured when using Central Package Management.
- If you are unable to onboard to [Package Source Mapping](../../consume-packages/Package-Source-Mapping.md) but want to use Central Package Management, you can suppress the warning:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <!-- Suppress Nu1507: There are 2 package sources defined in your configuration. When using central package management, please map your package sources with package source mapping or specify a single package source. -->
  <NoWarn>$(NoWarn);NU1507</NoWarn>
</PropertyGroup>
```
