# NuGet Error NU5026
> The file ''F:\project\bin\Debug\net461\project.exe' to be packed was not found on disk.

### Issue

The project being packed has not been built yet and hence cannot be packed.


### Solution

Please build the project before running dotnet pack operation or do not use `--no-build` option to allow dotnet pack to build the project before packaging.

You may have written a project that does not output assemblies. If you intend to ship an assembly-free NuGet package, disable `dotnet pack`â€™s requirement for an output assembly. You can do this by setting the `IncludeBuildOutput` property to `false` in your project file.

Also see [related msbuild properties](../msbuild-targets.md#output-assemblies).
