# NuGet Warning NU1508

## Scenario 1

> Duplicate 'NuGetAuditSuppress' items found. Remove the duplicate items or use the Update functionality to ensure a consistent restore behavior. The duplicate 'NuGetAuditSuppress' items are: https://contoso.test/cve/1 , https://contoso.test/cve/1 .

### Issue

Sometimes when adding `NuGetAuditSuppress` items, you may end up adding an item for a particular package multiple times.

MSBuild projects commonly import multiple `.props` and `.targets` files, so the duplicates might not be in the same file, but may be in included files, such as `Directory.Build.props`, `Directory.Packages.props`, or `Directory.Build.targets`.

### Solution

Remove the duplicate item, so that it's included exactly once.
