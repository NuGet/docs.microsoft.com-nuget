# NuGet Error NU1107

> Version conflict detected for 'PackageA'. Install/reference 'PackageA' v4.0.0 directly to resolve this issue.<br/> 'PackageB' 3.5.0 -> 'PackageA' (= 3.5.0)<br/> 'PackageC' 4.0.0 -> 'PackageA' (= 4.0.0)

### Issue
Unable to resolve dependency constraints between packages. Two different packages are asking for two different versions of 'PackageA'. The project needs to choose which version of 'PackageA' to use.

### Solution
Install/reference 'PackageA' directly (in the project file) with the exact version that you choose.
Generally, picking the higher version is the right choice.

To install a specific version, see the information for the tool that you're using:

- [Visual Studio](../../consume-packages/install-use-packages-visual-studio.md#update-a-package)
- [dotnet CLI](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-add-package)
- [nuget.exe CLI](../../consume-packages/install-use-packages-nuget-cli.md#install-a-specific-version-of-a-package)
- [Package Manager Console](../ps-reference/ps-ref-install-package.md)

[!INCLUDE [nugetsolver-tool](../../includes/nugetsolver-tool.md)]

### Note
Early versions of Visual Studio 2017 may have reported this as a warning (NU1607).
