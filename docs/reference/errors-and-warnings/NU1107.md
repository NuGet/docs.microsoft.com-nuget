# NuGet Error NU1107 (Previously NU1607)

<pre>Version conflict detected for 'PackageA'. Reference the package directly from the project to resolve this issue.<br/>  'PackageB' 3.5.0 -> 'PackageA' (= 3.5.0)<br/>  'PackageC' 4.0.0 -> 'PackageA' (= 4.0.0)</pre>

### Issue
Unable to resolve dependency constraints between packages.

### Solution
Packages with dependency constraints on exact versions do not allow other packages to increase the version if needed. Add a reference to the package directly (in the project file) with the exact version required.
