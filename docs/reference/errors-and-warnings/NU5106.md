# NuGet Warning NU5106
> The file at 'lib\WinRT\temp.dll' uses the obsolete 'WinRT' as the framework folder. Replace 'WinRT' or 'WinRT45' with 'NetCore45'.

### Issue

A file was detected to be under an `WinRT` or `WinRT45` target framework folder under the lib folder. However, `WinRT` and `WinRT45` target frameworks are now obsolete.


### Solution

Please rename the target framework folder to `NetCore45`.
