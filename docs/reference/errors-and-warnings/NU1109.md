# NuGet Error NU1109

> NU1109: Detected package downgrade: B from 2.0.0 to centrally defined 1.0.0. Update the centrally managed package version to a higher version.<br/>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;'Project' -> 'A' 1.0.0 -> 'B' (>= 2.0.0)<br/>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;'Project' -> 'B' (>= 1.0.0)

### Issue

A dependency package specified a version constraint on a higher version of a package than restore ultimately resolved. That is because of the [direct-dependency-wins](../../concepts/dependency-resolution.md#direct-dependency-wins) rule - when resolving packages, the direct package version in the subgraph will override that of the distant packages with the same ID.

This error is specific to transitive dependencies pinned using the [Transitive Pinning](../../consume-packages/Central-Package-Management.md#transitive-pinning)
feature. For other types of package downgrade issues, see [NU1605](./NU1605.md).

### Solution

Update the PackageVersion of B to to the higher version of the package.
In the example above, you would change the package version of `B` to 2.0.0.
