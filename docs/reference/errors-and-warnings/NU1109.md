# NuGet Error NU1109

<pre>NU1109: Detected package downgrade: B from 2.0.0 to centrally defined 1.0.0. Update the centrally managed package version to a higher version.</pre>
'Project' -> 'A' 1.0.0 -> 'B' (>= 2.0.0)<br/>  
'Project' -> 'B' (>= 1.0.0)</pre>

### Issue

A dependency package specified a version constraint on a higher version of a package than restore ultimately resolved. That is because of the [direct-dependency-wins](../../concepts/dependency-resolution.md#direct-dependency-wins) rule - when resolving packages, the direct package version in the subgraph will override that of the distant packages with the same ID.

### Solution

Update the PackageVersion of B to to the higher version of the package.
In the example above, you would change the package reference to `B` 2.0.0.
