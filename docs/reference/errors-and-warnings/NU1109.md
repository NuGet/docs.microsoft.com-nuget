# NuGet Error NU1109

> NU1109: Detected package downgrade: PackageB from 2.0.0 to centrally defined 1.0.0. Update the centrally managed package version to a higher version.<br/>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;'Project' -> 'PackageA' 1.0.0 -> 'PackageB' (>= 2.0.0)<br/>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;'Project' -> 'PackageB' (>= 1.0.0)

## Issue

A project is configured to use NuGet [Central Package Management](..\..\consume-packages\Central-Package-Management.md) and a transitive package dependency is pinned to a version lower than is specified by the dependency package.
When resolving packages, NuGet respects the [direct-dependency-wins](../../concepts/dependency-resolution.md#direct-dependency-wins) rule and the pinned package version overrides the version specified by the dependency package which results in a lower version of the package being resolved which could result in issues at runtime.

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <CentralPackageTransitivePinningEnabled>true</CentralPackageTransitivePinningEnabled>
</PropertyGroup>
<ItemGroup>
  <PackageVersion Include="PackageA" Version="1.0.0" />
  <PackageVersion Include="PackageB" Version="1.0.0" />
</ItemGroup>
```

## Solution
- Update the `PackageVersion` of `PackageB` to the higher version of the package.

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <PackageVersion Include="PackageB" Version="2.0.0" />
</ItemGroup>
```

- Disable Central Package Management transitive pinning to allow the package version specified by the dependency package to be used.
```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <CentralPackageTransitivePinningEnabled>false</CentralPackageTransitivePinningEnabled>
</PropertyGroup>
```
