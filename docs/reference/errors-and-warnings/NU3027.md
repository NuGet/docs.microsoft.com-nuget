# NuGet Warning NU3027

> Package 'SamplePackage v1.0.0' from source 'https://contoso.com/index.json': The signature should be timestamped to enable long-term signature validity after the certificate has expired.

### Issue

The package signature does not contain a timestamp.


### Solution

For long term signature validity, please request the package author to re-sign the package using the `nuget sign` command as described in [NuGet docs](../../create-packages/sign-a-package.md) using the `-Timestamper` option.
