# NuGet Warning NU3027

<pre>Package 'SamplePackage v1.0.0' from source 'http://source.com/index.json': The signature should be timestamped to enable long-term signature validity after the certificate has expired.</pre>

### Issue

The package signature does not contain a timestamp.


### Solution

For long term signature validity, please request the package author to resign the package using the `nuget sign` command as described in [NuGet docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/create-packages/sign-a-package) using the `-Timestamper` option.
