# NuGet Warning NU5119
<pre>File 'F:\project\binary\Libuv.1.10.0.nupkg' was not added to the package. Files and folders starting with '.' or ending with '.nupkg' are excluded by default. To include this file, use -NoDefaultExcludes from the commandline</pre>

### Issue

The NuGet pack operation found a `.nupkg` file or a file/folder starting with `.` to be added to the package.


### Solution

If you intend to package a `.nupkg` file or a file/folder starting with `.` then please use `-NoDefaultExcludes` property to allow the packaging of those files/folders.
