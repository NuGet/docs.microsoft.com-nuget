# NuGet Error NU5037
<pre>The package is missing the required nuspec file.</pre>

### Issue

Restore fails when the nuspec file is missing from the package.

### Solution
The solution to this issue depends upon project type and your version of NuGet.
* Package reference format - Package folder path is appended to the error message. Delete the package folder and run the restore again.
* Packages.config format - Package path is not appended to the error message. Identifying the package with missing nuspec file requires manual probing of dependencies. Delete corrupted package folder or entire packages folder if the package details are unknown and run the restore again.
