# NuGet Error NU5037
<pre>The package is missing the required nuspec file.</pre>

### Issue

Restore fails when the [nuspec](../nuspec.md) file is missing from the package on the feed, or from the global packages folder of the package.

## Scenario 1

nuspec file is missing from the package (nupkg) file.

### Solution

Contact the package author. 

## Scenario 2

Packages are managed using Package Reference format.

### Solution

Delete the package folder specified in the error message and run the restore again.

## Scenario 3

Restore fails for a project managed with the packages.config format.

### Solution

Package path is not appended to the error message. Identifying the package with missing nuspec file requires manual probing of dependencies. Delete corrupted package folder or entire solution packages folder if the package with missing nuspec file is unknown and run the restore again.
