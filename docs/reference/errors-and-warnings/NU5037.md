# NuGet Error NU5037
<pre>The package is missing the required nuspec file.</pre>

### Issue

Restore fails when nuspec file is missing from the package. This reflects cache corruption.

### Solution

* Package Reference style projects - Package folder path is appeneded to the error message. Delete package folder and run the restore again.
* Package Config style projects - Package folder path is not appeneded to the error message. Identifying package with missing nuspec file requires manual probing of the dependencies. Delete corrupted package or entire packages folder and run the restore again.
