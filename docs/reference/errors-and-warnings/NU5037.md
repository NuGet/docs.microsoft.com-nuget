# NuGet Error NU5037
<pre>The package is missing the required nuspec file.</pre>

### Issue

Restore fails when nuspec file is missing from the package. This reflects cache corruption.

### Solution
The solution to this issue depends upon project type and your version of NuGet.
* Package reference format - Package folder path is appeneded to the error message. Delete package folder and run the restore again.
* Packages.config format - Package path is not appeneded to the error message. Identifying package with missing nuspec file requires manual probing of dependencies. Delete corrupted package folder or entire packages folder if the package details are unknown and run the restore again.
