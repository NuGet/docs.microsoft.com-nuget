# NuGet Error NU5023
<pre>The assets file produced by restore does not exist. Try restoring the project again. The expected location of the assets file is F:\project\obj\project.assets.json.</pre>

### Issue

The project passed to the `msbuild -t:pack` does not contain an assets file in the obj directory.


### Solution

Please run `msbuild -t:restore` operation on the project being packaged before running the pack operation.
