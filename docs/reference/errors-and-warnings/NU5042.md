# NuGet Error NU5042 (Obsolete)

> [!WARNING]
> project.json support has been removed starting with  [NuGet 7.0](../../release-notes/NuGet-7.0.md) and this error will no longer be raised.

> `project.json` pack is disabled in the current NuGet version, and will be permanently removed in a future version.
> Please consider migrating 'MyProject' to `PackageReference` and using the pack targets.
> You can set the 'NUGET_ENABLE_LEGACY_PROJECT_JSON_PACK' environment variable to 'true' to temporarily reenable this functionality.

### Issue

NuGet.exe pack for project.json projects is not supported.

### Solution

[Migrate your project to PackageReference](../../archive/project-json.md#migrate-projectjson-to-packagereference) and use the pack targets instead.
