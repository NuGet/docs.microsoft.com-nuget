# NuGet Error NU5042

<pre>`project.json` pack is disabled in the current NuGet version, and will be permanently removed in a future version.
Please consider migrating 'MyProject' to `PackageReference` and using the pack targets.
You can set the 'NUGET_ENABLE_LEGACY_PROJECT_JSON_PACK' environment variable to 'true' to temporarily reenable this functionality.</pre>

### Issue

NuGet.exe pack for project.json projects is not supported.

### Solution

Migrate your project to PackageReference and use the pack targets instead.
