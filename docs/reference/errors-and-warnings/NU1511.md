# NuGet Warning NU1511

## Scenario 1

> A ProjectReference cannot be pruned, X.

### Issue

The project id `X` has been specified for pruning through the [PrunePackageReference](../../consume-packages/Package-References-in-Project-Files.md#prunepackagereference) feature.
Pruning of projects is not supported.

### Solution

- The `.NET SDK` generally specifies the list of packages to be pruned. It may mean that you have a project matching the id of a platform assembly.
In this scenario, change the name of the project.
- If the `PrunePackageReference` has been specified within your project, you may need to remove the `PrunePackageReference`
