# NuGet Error NU1101

## Scenario 1

<pre>Unable to find package 'PackageId'. No packages exist with this id in source(s): sourceA, sourceB, sourceC</pre>

### Issue
The package cannot be found on any sources.

### Solution
Examine the project's dependencies in Visual Studio to be sure you're using the correct package identifier and version number. Also check that the [NuGet configuration](../../consume-packages/Configuring-NuGet-Behavior.md) identifies the package sources you are expected to be using. If you use packages that have [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](../../concepts/package-versioning.md#semantic-versioning-200), please make sure that you are using the V3 feed, `https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json`, in the [NuGet configuration](../../consume-packages/Configuring-NuGet-Behavior.md).

## Scenario 2

<pre>Unable to find package 'PackageId'. No packages exist with this id in source(s): sourceA PackageSourceMapping is enabled, the following source(s) were not considered: sourceB, sourceC.
</pre>

### Issue
The package cannot be found on any of the PackageSourceMapping configured sources.

### Solution

Examine the project's dependencies in Visual Studio to be sure you're using the correct package identifier and version number.
Check your [NuGet.Config](../../consume-packages/Configuring-NuGet-Behavior.md) for the [PackageSourceMapping](../../consume-packages/Package-Source-Mapping.md) configuration. The package in question may be available on a source that is not configured.
