# NuGet Error NU1009

> The following PackageReference items are implicitly defined and cannot define a PackageVersion item: PackageName.  Projects using Central Package Management require that implicit package versions be specified by the PackageReference item.

## Issue

A project is configured to use NuGet [Central Package Management](../../consume-packages/Central-Package-Management.md) and a `<PackageVersion />` item is defined in the [Directory.Packages.props](../../consume-packages/Central-Package-Management.md#enabling-central-package-management) file for a package that is [implicitly defined](https://aka.ms/sdkimplicitrefs).
Implicitly defined packages are generally declared by an SDK to include packages on your behalf.
For these packages, the owner of the SDK controls the version being used and a user should not define a version with [Central Package Management](../../consume-packages/Central-Package-Management.md).

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.NETCore.App" Version="9.0.0" IsImplicitlyDefined="true" />
</ItemGroup>
```

## Solution

- Remove the `PackageVersion` item from the [Directory.Packages.props](../../consume-packages/Central-Package-Management.md#enabling-central-package-management) file that corresponds to the implicitly defined package:

  ```xml
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageVersion Include="Microsoft.NETCore.App" Version="1.0.0" />
  </ItemGroup>
  ```

> [!NOTE]
> Some SDKs allow you to override the implicitly defined package version by setting a specific MSBuild property for that package and the SDK may have documentation on how to do so.
