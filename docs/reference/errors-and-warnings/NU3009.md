# NuGet Warning NU3009

<pre>Package 'SamplePackage v1.0.0' from source 'http://source.com/index.json': The package signature file does not contain exactly one primary signature.</pre>

### Issue

NuGet client tried to verify a package signature which contained multiple `SignerInfo` fields.


### Solution

Please request the package author to resign the package using the `nuget sign` command as described in [NuGet docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/create-packages/sign-a-package). If the problem persists, then please file an issue at [NuGet/Home](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues) along with the package that generated this problem.
