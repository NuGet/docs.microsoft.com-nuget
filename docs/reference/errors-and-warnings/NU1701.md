# NuGet Warning NU1701

<pre>Package 'packageId' was restored using 'TargetFrameworkA' instead the project target framework 'TargetFrameworkB'. This package may not be fully compatible with your project.</pre>

### Issue
`PackageTargetFallback` / `AssetTargetFallback` was used to select assets from a package. The warning let users know that the assets may not be 100% compatible.

### Solution
- Change the project's target framework to one that the package supports.
- Give our new experimental one-click tool, [NuGetSolver](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/nuget/introducing-nugetsolver-a-powerful-tool-for-resolving-nuget-dependency-conflicts-in-visual-studio/), a try. This tool can automatically fix this problem if youâ€™re using VS2022 with nuget.org. Please provide us with feedback. Based on the feedback received, we will decide whether to officially support this new tool and incorporate it into the NuGet package manager.
