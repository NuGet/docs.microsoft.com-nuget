# NuGet Warning NU1701

> Package 'packageId' was restored using 'TargetFrameworkA' instead the project target framework 'TargetFrameworkB'. This package may not be fully compatible with your project.

### Issue
`AssetTargetFallback` was used to select assets from a package. The warning let users know that the assets may not be 100% compatible.

### Solution
Change the project's target framework to one that the package supports.
