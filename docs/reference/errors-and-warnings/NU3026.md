# NuGet Warning NU3026

> Package 'SamplePackage v1.0.0' from source 'https://contoso.com/index.json': The timestamp response is invalid. Nonces did not match.

### Issue

The timestamp authority did not return an expected nonce in its response; therefore, its response is invalid.


### Solution

Try to re-sign and timestamp the package. If the problem persists, contact the timestamp authority to discover the source of the problem.
