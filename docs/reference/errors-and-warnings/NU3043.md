# NuGet Warning NU3043

> Invalid value for `--certificate-fingerprint` option in the `dotnet nuget sign` command or the `CertificateFingerprint` option in the `NuGet.exe sign` command.
The value must be a SHA-256, SHA-384, or SHA-512 certificate fingerprint (in hexadecimal).

> This warning will be promoted to an error around the .NET 10 timeframe.

## Issue

Starting with .NET 9 and NuGet.exe 6.12, NU3043 warning is raised when a SHA-1 certificate fingerprint is passed to the sign commands.
SHA-1 is considered insecure and should no longer be used.

## Solution

To resolve this warning, ensure that you provide a valid SHA-256, SHA-384, or SHA-512 certificate fingerprint (in hexadecimal) for the `--certificate-fingerprint` option in the `dotnet nuget sign` command or the `CertificateFingerprint` option in the `NuGet.exe sign` command.

Customers can use the following PowerShell script to compute SHA-2 family hashes for certificates.
To use the script, customers need to save the certificate to a local folder.

```powershell
$certificate = [System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate2]::new($certPath)
$stream = [System.IO.MemoryStream]::new($certificate.RawData)

Try
{
    (Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 $stream).Hash
}
Finally
{
    $stream.Dispose()
    $certificate.Dispose()
}
```
