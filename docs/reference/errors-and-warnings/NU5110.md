# NuGet Warning NU5110
<pre>The script file 'other\init.ps1' is outside the 'tools' folder and hence will not be executed during installation of this package. Move it into the 'tools' folder.</pre>

### Issue

An `.ps1` file was detected in a folder other than `tools` folder.


### Solution

Please place the `.ps1`  file under the `tools` folder for it to be compatible with NuGet tooling.
