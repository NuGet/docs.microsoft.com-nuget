# NuGet Warning NU1212

## Scenario 1

<pre>Invalid project-package combination for Contoso.Library 1.0.0. DotnetToolReference project style can only contain references of the DotnetTool type</pre>

### Issue

`DotnetToolReference` project style can only reference .NET tools with the [DotnetTool](../../create-packages/set-package-type.md#known-package-types) package type. Either the project style is not `DotnetToolReference` or a referenced package is not of `DotnetTool` type.

### Solution

Projects of this style are normally not ordinary projects and the [dotnet tool](/dotnet/core/tools/global-tools) commands should be used to manage your dotnet tools.
Contoso.Library is not a `DotnetTool` package.
Use a different package that's of the `DotnetTool` type.

## Scenario 2

<pre>Invalid project-package combination for Contoso.Library 1.0.0. DotnetToolReference project style can only contain references of the DotnetTool type</pre>

### Issue

`DotnetToolReference` project style can only reference .NET tools with the [DotnetTool](../../create-packages/set-package-type.md#known-package-types) package type. Either the project style is not `DotnetToolReference` or a referenced package is not of `DotnetTool` type.

### Solution

Projects of this style are normally not ordinary projects and the [dotnet tool](/dotnet/core/tools/global-tools) commands should be used to manage your dotnet tools.

The project in question is not a DotnetToolReference project, but the package is of the DotnetTool type.
Change the RestoreProjectStyle to DotnetToolReference.
