# NuGet Error NU1201

### Example 1
> Project 'ProjectA' is not compatible with 'TargetFramework'. Project 'ProjectA' supports:<br/> - 'TargetFrameworkA'<br/> - 'TargetFrameworkB'

### Issue
A dependency project doesn't contain a framework compatible with the current project. Typically, the project's target framework is a higher version than the consuming project.

### Solution
Change the project's target framework to an equal or lower version than the consuming project.

### Example 2 - NetStandard targetted projects cannot reference NetCoreApp targetted projects
> Project 'ProjectB' is not compatible with netstandard2.0 (.NETStandard,Version=v2.0). Project 'ProjectB' supports: netcoreapp2.0 (.NETCoreApp,Version=v2.0)

### Issue 
In this case:
- ProjectA targets NetStandard 2.0
- ProjectB targets NetCoreApp 2.0
- ProjectA has a project reference to ProjectB

NetStandard projects can never depend on a NetCoreApp project.

### Solution
Either:
- change ProjectA to target NetCoreApp 2.0

or

- change ProjectB to target NetStandard 2.0
