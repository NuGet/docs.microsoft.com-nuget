# NuGet Error NU1005

<pre>Invalid restore input where RestorePackagesWithLockFile property is set to false but a packages lock file exists at C:\SourceCode\ContosoProject\Contoso.Library\packages.lock.json</pre>

### Issue

There are 2 opt-in methods the lock file functionality, by setting the RestorePackagesWithLockFile property, or create a packages.lock.json next to the project file, and they are conflicting.

### Solution

- If you wish to continue using the lock file functionality, change RestorePackagesWithLockFile to `true`.
- If you to wish to stop using the lock file functionality, remove the packages.lock.json file.
