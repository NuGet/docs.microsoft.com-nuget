# NuGet Warning NU1211

> Project `DotnelToolReferenceProject.csproj` must have a single package reference(s).

### Issue

The project you are attempting to restore has special restrictions and exactly 1 PackageReference package must be specified.

### Solution

Projects of this style are normally not ordinary projects and the [dotnet tool](/dotnet/core/tools/global-tools) commands should be used to manage your dotnet tools.
Alternatively, change your project to specify exactly 1 package.
