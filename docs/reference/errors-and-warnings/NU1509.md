# NuGet Warning NU1509

## Scenario 1

> Duplicate 'PrunePackageReference' items found. Remove the duplicate items or use the Update functionality to ensure a consistent restore behavior. The duplicate 'PrunePackageReference' items are: X 1.0.0, X 2.0.0.

### Issue

Sometimes when adding `PrunePackageReference` items, you may end up adding an item for a particular package multiple times.

MSBuild projects commonly import multiple `.props` and `.targets` files, so the duplicates might not be in the same file, but may be in imported files, such as `Directory.Build.props`, `Directory.Packages.props`, or `Directory.Build.targets`.

The `.NET SDK` provides a of list `PrunePackageReference`, so the conflict may be happening because you have specified a `PrunePackageReference` or due to a bug with the `.NET SDK`.

### Solution

Remove the duplicate item, so that it's included exactly once.
