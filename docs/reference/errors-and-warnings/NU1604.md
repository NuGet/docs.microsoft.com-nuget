# NuGet Warning NU1604

> Project dependency 'PackageA' (&lt;= 9.0.0) does not contain an inclusive lower bound. Include a lower bound in the dependency version to ensure consistent restore results.

### Issue
A project dependency doesn't define a lower bound.<br/><br/>This means that restore did not find the *best match*. Each restore will float downwards trying to find a lower version that can be used. This means that restore goes online to check all sources each time instead of using the packages that already exist in the user package folder.

### Solution
Update the project's `PackageReference` `Version` attribute to include a lower bound.
For example change from:

> `<PackageReference Version="(9.0.0, )" />`

to:

> `<PackageReference Version="[9.0.0, )" />`

or

> `<PackageReference Version="9.0.0" />`

which implies a lower bound.
