# NuGet Error NU5036
> This package has an improperly escaped Url in LicenseUrl

### Issue

LicenseUrl metadata value in the nuspec file should be properly escaped.
Some versions of nuget pack functionality have a problem which will be updated asap.

### Solution

Use a fixed version of nuget pack functionality:
* "NuGet.exe pack" - fixed in 4.9.1
* "dotnet.exe pack" - broken in 2.1.500. No fix available yet. (don't use new License expression or file feature yet, to avoid problem.)
* "msbuild /t:pack" - broken in Visual Studio 15.9.1. No fix available yet. (don't use new License expression or file feature yet, to avoid problem.)
