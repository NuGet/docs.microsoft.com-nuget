# NuGet Error NU1010

> The following PackageReference items do not define a corresponding PackageVersion item: PackageName. Projects using Central Package Management must declare PackageReference and PackageVersion items with matching names

## Issue

A project is configured to use NuGet [Central Package Management](../../consume-packages/Central-Package-Management.md) and a `<PackageReference />` item is defined but a corresponding `<PackageVersion />` item with the same name is not defined in the [Directory.Packages.props](../../consume-packages/Central-Package-Management.md#enabling-central-package-management) file:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <PackageReference Include="PackageName" />
</ItemGroup>
```

## Solution

- Define a `<PackageVersion />` item that specifies the version in the [Directory.Packages.props](../../consume-packages/Central-Package-Management.md#enabling-central-package-management) file with the same identifier as the `<PackageReference />` item:

  ```xml
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageVersion Include="PackageName" Version="5.0.1" />
  </ItemGroup>
  ```
- If a `<PackageVersion />` item is properly defined and this error occurs in Visual Studio, check the Error List window for errors related to loading the project or failed [design time builds](https://github.com/dotnet/project-system/blob/main/docs/design-time-builds.md).
If Visual Studio is not able to successfully load the project or a design time build fails, NuGet may log this error because it does not have the required information to restore.
Resolving these underlying issues should fix this error.
