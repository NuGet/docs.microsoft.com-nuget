# NuGet Warning NU5100
> The assembly 'bin\Debug\net461\project.dll' is not inside the 'lib' folder and hence it won't be added as a reference when the package is installed into a project. Move it into the 'lib' folder if it needs to be referenced.

### Issue

The folder being packaged contains an assembly file that is not in `lib` folder.


### Solution

While packaging a folder please ensure that all assembly files are placed inside a framework-specific folder under a `lib` folder. For more information on the folder structure, see [Framework version folder structure](../../create-packages/supporting-multiple-target-frameworks.md#framework-version-folder-structure).
