# NuGet Warning NU3018

<pre>Package 'SamplePackage v1.0.0' from source 'https://contoso.com/index.json': The primary signature's signing certificate is not trusted by the trust provider.</pre>

### Issue

NuGet client failed to verify the certificate chain for the signing certificate used to sign the package.

### Solution

Please ensure that the package signature has a valid certificate chain. You can verify the package signature by running the `nuget verify -signatures` or `dotnet nuget verify` command on the package. If the problem persists, then please file an issue at [NuGet/Home](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues) along with the package that generated this problem.

> [!Note]
> When NuGet’s [signature validation mode](../../consume-packages/installing-signed-packages.md#configure-package-signature-requirements) is set to accept (default), NU3018 is raised as a warning.
> When NuGet’s signature validation mode is set to require, or when running the `nuget verify -signatures` command, NU3018 is elevated from a warning to an error in most cases.

For Linux and macOS, see [NuGet signed-package verification](/dotnet/core/tools/nuget-signed-package-verification).  Specifically for untrusted root certificate warnings/errors on Linux and macOS, also see [NU3042](NU3042.md).
