# NuGet Error NU1102

<pre>Unable to find package 'PackageId' with version (>= 9.0.1)<br/>  - Found 30 version(s) in 'sourceA' [ Nearest version: '4.0.0' ]<br/>  - Found 10 version(s) in 'sourceB' [ Nearest version: '4.0.0-rc-2129' ]<br/>  - Found 9 version(s) in 'sourceC' [ Nearest version: '3.0.0-beta-00032' ]<br/>  - Found 0 version(s) in 'sourceD'<br/>  - Found 0 version(s) in 'sourceE'</pre>

### Issue
The package identifier is found but a version within the specified dependency range cannot be found on any of the sources. The range might be specified by a package and not the user.

### Solution
Edit the project file to correct the package version. Also check that the [NuGet configuration](../../consume-packages/Configuring-NuGet-Behavior.md) identifies the package sources your expect to be using. You may need to change the requested version if this package is referenced by the project directly.
