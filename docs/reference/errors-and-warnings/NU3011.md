# NuGet Warning NU3011

> Package 'SamplePackage v1.0.0' from source 'https://contoso.com/index.json': The primary signature is invalid.

### Issue

NuGet client was unable to read the certificate chain for the signing certificate used to sign the package.


### Solution

Please request the package author to re-sign the package using the `nuget sign` command as described in [NuGet docs](../../create-packages/sign-a-package.md). If the problem persists, then please file an issue at [NuGet/Home](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues) along with the package that generated this problem.


> [!Note]
> When NuGet’s [signature validation mode](../../consume-packages/installing-signed-packages.md#configure-package-signature-requirements) is set to accept (default), NU3011 is raised as a warning. 
> When NuGet’s signature validation mode is set to require, or when running the `nuget verify -signatures` command, NU3011 is elevated from a warning to an error.
