# NuGet Error NU3004

<pre>Package 'SamplePackage v1.0.0' from source 'http://source.com/index.json': The package is not signed.</pre>
<pre>Package 'SamplePackage v1.0.0' from source 'http://source.com/index.json': signatureValidationMode is set to require, so packages are allowed only if signed by trusted signers; however, this package is unsigned.</pre>
<pre>Package 'SamplePackage v1.0.0' from source 'http://source.com/index.json': This repository indicated that all its packages are repository signed; however, this package is unsigned.</pre>

### Issue

**If from `nuget verify -signatures`**

NuGet client tried to verify an unsigned package.

**If from restore or install when specifying `signatureValidationMode` to `require`**

The `require` validation mode does not support unsigned package and an unsigned package is trying to be installed.

### Solution

Please ensure that any package intended to be installed or passed to `nuget verify -signatures` command contains a package signature.
