# NuGet Warning NU1602

> 'PackageA' 4.0.0 does not provide an inclusive lower bound for dependency 'PackageB' (> 3.5.0). An approximate best match of 3.6.0 was resolved.

### Issue
A package dependency is missing a lower bound. This doesn't allow restore to find the *best match*. Each restore will float downwards trying to find a lower version that can be used. This means that restore goes online to check all sources each time instead of using the packages that already exist in the user package folder.

### Solution
This is usually a package authoring error. Contact the package author to resolve the issue.
