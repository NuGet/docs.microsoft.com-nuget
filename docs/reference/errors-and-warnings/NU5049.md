# NuGet Error NU5049

> The `pack` command for SDK-style projects is not supported, use `dotnet pack` or `msbuild -t:pack` to pack this project instead. You can override this behavior by setting the 'NUGET_ENABLE_LEGACY_CSPROJ_PACK' environment variable to 'true'.

### Issue

NuGet.exe pack should not be used to generate packages for SDK-style projects.

### Solution

Use `dotnet pack` or `msbuild -t:pack` instead.
It recommended that you do not use the legacy csproj pack experience as it generates incomplete packages.
