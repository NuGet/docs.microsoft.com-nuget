# NuGet Warning NU1801

### Issue
An error occurred when reading the feed when `IgnoreFailedSources` is set to true, converting it to a non-fatal warning. This could contain any message and is generic.

Note that if `IgnoreFailedSources` is not enabled, [NU1301](./NU1301.md) will be raised instead.

### Solution
Edit your configuration to specify valid sources.
