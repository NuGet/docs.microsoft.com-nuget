# NuGet Warning NU5118
<pre>File 'F :\validation\test\proj\tools\readme.1.txt' is not added because the package already contains file 'tools\readme.txt'</pre>

### Issue

A file added as `Content` in the project file could not be added to the package being generated because another with the same `PackagePath` was already added to the package.


### Solution

Please ensure that any `Content` files being added to the package using the project file have unique `PackagePath` metadata.
