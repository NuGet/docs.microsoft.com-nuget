# NuGet Warning NU3002

## Example 1

```text
warning NU1900: Error occurred while getting package vulnerability data: (more information)
```

### Issue

Vulnerability data could not be downloaded from one of the package sources.

### Solution

This warning generally means that there is a problem with the package source.

If the error is related to networking, such as unable to connect to server, a timeout, a DNS error, and so on, then retrying after waiting a few minutes might resolve the issue.

If the error is a JSON deserialization error, this suggests the package source returned invalid data to NuGet.
You can try clearing NuGet's HTTP cache (`dotnet nuget locals http-cache --clear` from the command line) and try again.
If issues persist, then contact the package source maintainers.

For more information, see [the documentation on auditing packages](../../concepts/Auditing-Packages.md).

## Example 2

```text
warning NU1902: Package 'Contoso.Utilities' 1.0.0 has a known unknown severity vulnerability, https://cve.contoso.com/advisories/1
```

### Issue

The server provided vulnerability data for the package, but provided an invalid severity value.
If you know which package source provided the invalid data, you can contact the server maintainers to inform them that their vulnerability data does not comply with [NuGet's server API](../../api/vulnerability-info.md)
