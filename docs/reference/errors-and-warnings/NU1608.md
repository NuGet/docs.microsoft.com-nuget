# NuGet Warning NU1608

> Detected package version outside of dependency constraint: 'PackageA' 1.0.0 requires 'PackageB' (= 1.0.0) but version 'PackageB' 2.0.0 was resolved.

### Issue
A resolved package is higher than a dependency constraint allows. This means that a package referenced directly by a project overrides dependency constraints from other packages.

### Solution
In some cases this is intentional and the warning can be suppressed. Otherwise, change the project's reference to the package to widen its version constraints.
