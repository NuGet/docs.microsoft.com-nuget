# NuGet Error NU5004
> Failed to build package. Ensure 'F:\project\project.nuspec' includes assembly files. For help on building symbols package, visit https://docs.nuget.org/.

### Issue

The NuGet pack operation was performed using `-Symbol` option, but the folder containing the nuspec file contained no assembly files. 


### Solution

When building a symbols package, ensure that the folder containing the nuspec file contains assembly files for which the symbols need to be packaged.
