# NuGet Error NU5004
<pre>Failed to build package. Ensure 'F:\project\project.nuspec' includes assembly files. For help on building symbols package, visit http://docs.nuget.org/.</pre>

### Issue

NuGet pack operation was performed using `-Symbol` option, but the folder containing the nuspec file contained no assembly files. 


### Solution

When building a symbols package, ensure that the folder containing the nuspec file contains assembly files for which the symbols need to be packaged.
