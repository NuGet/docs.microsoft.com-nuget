# NuGet Warning NU3024

## Scenario 1

> Package 'SamplePackage v1.0.0' from source 'https://contoso.com/index.json': The timestamp signature has an unsupported digest algorithm. The following algorithms are supported: : SHA-2-256, SHA-2-384, SHA-2-512.

### Issue

The timestamp's signature has an unsupported digest algorithm.


### Solution

Ensure that the timestamp authority's signature has one of the following digest algorithms - 
* `SHA-2-256`
* `SHA-2-384`
* `SHA-2-512`



## Scenario 2

> Package 'SamplePackage v1.0.0' from source 'https://contoso.com/index.json': The primary signature's timestamp signature has an unsupported digest algorithm.

### Issue

The timestamp's signature has an unsupported digest algorithm.


### Solution

Request the package author to re-sign the package using the `nuget sign` command as described in [NuGet docs](../../create-packages/sign-a-package.md) using the `-Timestamper` option such that the timestamp authority signing certificate has one of the following digest algorithms -
* `SHA-2-256`
* `SHA-2-384`
* `SHA-2-512`


> [!Note]
> When running the `nuget verify -signatures` command, NU3024 is raised as an error. Otherwise, NU3024 is raised as a warning.
