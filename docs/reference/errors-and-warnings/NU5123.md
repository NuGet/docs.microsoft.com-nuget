# NuGet Warning NU5123
<pre>The file 'content/<LongPath>/readme.txt' path, name, or both are too long. Your package might not work without long file path support. Please shorten the file path or file name.</pre>

### Issue

A file was detected to have an installed path of longer than 200 characters. Installed path is defined as the `<package_id>/<version>/target_file_path`, where `target_file_path` is defined in the `target` property of the`<files>` section in the nuspec file.


### Solution

Please ensure that the path `<package_id>/<version>/target_file_path` for all the files included in the package are lesser than 200 characters, where `target_file_path` is defined in the `target` property of the`<files>` section in the nuspec file.
