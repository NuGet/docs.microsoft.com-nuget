# NuGet Warning NU5500

### Issue

The NuGet pack operation had a problem. NU5000 is used when we haven't yet assigned a unique warning code for that issue. So we can improve, please feel free to file the issue with details of your error.


### Solution

Check the output window (in Visual Studio) or console output (with NuGet or dotnet command line tools) for more information.
