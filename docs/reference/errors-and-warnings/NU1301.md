# NuGet Warning NU1301

<pre>The local source 'C:\Code\Contoso\contosoLocalSource' doesn't exist.</pre>

### Issue

Restore could not be completed because the listed source is unavailable.

### Solution

Consult the error message for more details. You may need to inform the source owner as there might be issues that only they can address.

Alternatively, you can try removing the source from the configuration retry again. The configured source may not be necessary for your build.
