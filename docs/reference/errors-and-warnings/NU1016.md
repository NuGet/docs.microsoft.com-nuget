# NuGet Error NU1016

> Managing packages with project.json is deprecated. Migrate to PackageReference.

### Issue

Managing packages with project.json is deprecated. Migrate to PackageReference.

### Solution

[Migrate your project from project.json to PackageReference](../../archive/project-json.md#migrate-projectjson-to-packagereference).

The migration between project.json and PackageReference is straightforward. The easiest way is to use the built-in migrator in Visual Studio:

1. Open your project.json project in Visual Studio
2. In Solution Explorer, find the project's Dependencies node
3. Right-click and select **Migrate project.json to PackageReference...**

Alternatively, you can manually migrate by:

1. Converting your project file to the SDK-style format
2. Moving package dependencies from `project.json` to `<PackageReference>` elements in your `.csproj` file
3. Removing the `project.json` and `project.lock.json` files

For detailed migration guidance, see the [project.json reference documentation](../../archive/project-json.md).

For more information about package management formats, see [Package references in project files](../../consume-packages/Package-References-in-Project-Files.md).
