# NuGet Error NU1016

> Managing packages with project.json is deprecated. Migrate to PackageReference.

### Issue

Managing packages with project.json is deprecated. Migrate to PackageReference.

### Solution

[Migrate your project from project.json to PackageReference](../../archive/project-json.md#migrate-projectjson-to-packagereference).

**Visual Studio 2026 or newer:**

Your project.json project will be automatically migrated to PackageReference when you open the solution. Visual Studio will create a backup of the original files in a `Backup` folder in the project directory.

**Visual Studio 2022:**

You need to use the built-in migrator:

1. Open your project.json project in Visual Studio
1. In Solution Explorer, find the project's Dependencies node
1. Right-click and select **Migrate project.json to PackageReference...**

For detailed migration guidance, see the [project.json reference documentation](../../archive/project-json.md).

For more information about package management formats, see [Package references in project files](../../consume-packages/Package-References-in-Project-Files.md).
