# NuGet Error NU1203

> 'PackageId' 1.0.0 provides a compile-time reference assembly for 'Foo.dll' on 'TargetFramework', but there is no compatible run-time assembly.

### Issue
The package doesn't support the project's `RuntimeIdentifier`. 

### Solution
Change the `RuntimeIdentifier` values used in the project as needed.
