# NuGet 4.7 RTM Release Notes

[Visual Studio 2017 15.7 RTW](https://www.visualstudio.com/news/releasenotes/vs2017-relnotes) comes with [NuGet 4.7.0](https://dist.nuget.org/win-x86-commandline/v4.7.0/nuget.exe).

## Summary: What's New in this Release

* We have augemented package signing to enable [Repository Signing packages](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/6378)

* With Visual Studio Version 15.7, we have introduced the capability to [migrate existing projects that use the packages.config format to use PackageReference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/migrate-packages-config-to-package-reference) instead.

## Known issues

### Issues with .NET Standard 2.0 with .NET Framework & NuGet

.NET Standard & its tooling was designed such that projects targeting .NET Framework 4.6.1 can consume NuGet packages & projects targeting .NET Standard 2.0 or earlier. [This document](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/481) summarizes the issues around that scenario, the plan for addressing them, and workarounds you can deploy with today's state of the tooling.
