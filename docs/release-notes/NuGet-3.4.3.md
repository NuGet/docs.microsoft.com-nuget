NuGet 3.4.3 was released on April 22, 2016 to address several issues that were identified in the 3.4 and subsequent releases.

You can download both the VSIX and nuget.exe [here](https://dist.nuget.org/index.html).

## Updates and Improvements

## Fixes

* Fixed some authorization issues with password protected private nuget feeds.
* Fixed an issue around being unable to restore PCL's from `project.json` with runtimes specified.
* Some customers were running into intermittent failures when installing packages. This has now been fixed in this release.
* Fixed an issue that caused restore failures in C++/CLI projects with `project.json`.
