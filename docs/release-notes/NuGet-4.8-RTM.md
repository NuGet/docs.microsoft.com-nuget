# NuGet 4.8 RTM Release Notes

[Visual Studio 2017 15.8 RTW](https://www.visualstudio.com/news/releasenotes/vs2017-relnotes) comes with NuGet 4.8 functionality.


Command line versions of the same functionality are also available:
* NuGet.exe 4.8 - [nuget.org/downloads](https://nuget.org/downloads)
* DotNet.exe - [.NET Core SDK 2.1.400](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/visual-studio-sdks)


## Summary: What's New in this Release
* NuGet.exe now supports longfilenames on Windows 10 - [#6937](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/6937)
* Authentication plugins now work across MsBuild, DotNet.exe, NuGet.exe and Visual Studio, including cross platform. The first generation of authentication plugins were not supported in MsBuild, DotNet.exe. Note: VS 2017 15.9 Preview builds have a VSTS authentication plugin included. [#6486](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/6486)
* MsBuild's SDK Resolver now builds as part of NuGet and installs with NuGet tools for VS. This will avoid versions getting out sync. [#6799](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/6799)
* PackageReference now supports DevelopmentDependency metadata - [#4125](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/4125)

## Known issues
### Installing signed packages on a CI machine or in an offline environment takes longer than usual

#### Issue
If the machine has restricted internet access (such as a build machine in a CI/CD scenario), installing/restoring a signed nuget package will result a warning ([NU3028](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/errors-and-warnings/nu3028)) since the revocation servers are not reachable. This is expected. However, in some cases, this may have unintended concequences such as the package install/restore taking longer than usual.

#### Workaround
Update to Visual Studio 15.8.4 and NuGet.exe 4.8.1 where we introduced an environment variable to switch the revocation check mode.
Setting the `NUGET_CERT_REVOCATION_MODE` environment variable to `offline` will force NuGet to check the revocation status of the certificate only against the cached certificate revocation list, and NuGet will not attempt to reach revocation servers. When the revocation check mode is set to `offline`, the warning will be downgraded to an info.

> [!Warning]
> It is not recommended to switch the revocation check mode to offline under normal cirumstances. Doing so will cause NuGet to skip online revocation check and perform only an offline revocation check against the cached certificate revocation list which may be out of date. This means packages where the signing certificate may have been revoked, will continue to be installed/restored, which otherwise would have failed revocation check and would not have been installed.

### The `Migrate packages.config to PackageReference...` option is not available in the right-click context menu

#### Issue

When a project is first opened, NuGet may not have initialized until a NuGet operation is performed. This causes the migration option to not show up in the right-click context menu on `packages.config` or `References`.

#### Workaround

Perform any one of the following NuGet actions:
* Open the Package Manager UI - Right-click on `References` and select `Manage NuGet Packages...`
* Open the Package Manager Console - From `Tools > NuGet Package Manager`, select `Package Manager Console`
* Run NuGet restore - Right-click on the solution node in the Solution Explorer and select `Restore NuGet Packages`
* Build the project which also triggers NuGet restore

You should now be able to see the migration option. Note that this option is not supported and will not show up for ASP.NET and C++ project types.
Note: This has been fixed in VS 2017 15.9 Preview 3
