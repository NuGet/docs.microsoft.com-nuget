# NuGet 4.6 RTM Release Notes

[Visual Studio 2017 15.6 RTW](https://www.visualstudio.com/news/releasenotes/vs2017-relnotes) comes with [NuGet 4.6.0](https://dist.nuget.org/win-x86-commandline/v4.6.0/nuget.exe).

## Summary: What's New in this Release

* We have added support for [signing packages](../create-packages/sign-a-package.md).
* Visual Studio 2017 and nuget.exe now verifies package integrity before installing, restoring packages for [signed packages](../reference/signed-packages-reference.md).
* We have improved performance of successive restores.

## Known issues

### Issues with .NET Standard 2.0 with .NET Framework & NuGet 

.NET Standard & its tooling was designed such that projects targeting .NET Framework 4.6.1 can consume NuGet packages & projects targeting .NET Standard 2.0 or earlier. [This document](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/481) summarizes the issues around that scenario, the plan for addressing them, and workarounds you can deploy with today's state of the tooling.
