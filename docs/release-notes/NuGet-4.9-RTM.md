## Summary: What's New in 4.9.4

* Security Fix: Permissions on files created inside ~/.nuget are too open [#7673](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/7673) [CVE-2019-0757](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-0757)


## Known issues

### dotnet nuget push --interactive gives an error on Mac. - [#7519](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/7519)

#### Issue
The `--interactive` argument is not being forwarded by the dotnet cli and results in the error `error: Missing value for option 'interactive'`

#### Workaround
Run any other dotnet command with the interactive option such as `dotnet restore --interactive` and authenticate. The authentication then might be cached by the credential provider. Then run `dotnet nuget push`.

### Packages in FallbackFolders installed by .NET Core SDK are custom installed, and fail signature validation. - [#7414](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/7414)

#### Issue
When using dotnet.exe 2.x to restore a project that multi-targets netcoreapp 1.x and netcoreapp 2.x, the fallback folder is treated as a file feed. This means, when restoring, NuGet will pick the package from the fallback folder and try to install it into the global packages folder and do the usual signing validation which fails.

#### Workaround
Disable the usage of the fallback folder by setting the `RestoreAdditionalProjectSources` to nothing. `<RestoreAdditionalProjectSources/>` Use this with caution as it will cause a lot of packages to be downloaded from NuGet.org which otherwise would be have been restored from the fallback folder.
