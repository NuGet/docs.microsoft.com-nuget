# NuGet API in Visual Studio

In addition to the Package Manager UI and Console in Visual Studio, NuGet also exports some useful services that other extensions can use. These interfaces allow other components in Visual Studio to interact with NuGet, which can be used to install and uninstall packages, and to obtain information about installed packages.

NuGet provides services via two different technologies, each of which have their interfaces defined in a different NuGet package. NuGet's older services are available via [the Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF)](/dotnet/framework/mef/), which are available in the package [NuGet.VisualStudio](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NuGet.VisualStudio) ([go to NuGet's MEF services](#mef-services)). There are newer APIs, designed to be usable with `async` code, available in the package `NuGet.VisualStudio.Contracts`, using a Visual Studio's `IServiceBroker` ([go to NuGet's Brokered Services](#brokered-services)).

## Package Versions

NuGet's product follows Visual Studio's version, but is 11.0 versions behind. For example, NuGet 6.0 corresponds to Visual Studio 2022 17.0, NuGet 5.11 corresponds to Visual Studio 2019 16.11, and so on.

Starting from Visual Studio 17.1, NuGet's Visual Studio extensibility API packages match the version of Visual Studio that the APIs are targeting. For example, NuGet.VisualStudio and NuGet.VisualStudio.Contracts package version 17.1.0 should be used when your extension targets Visual Studio 17.1 and higher. In Visual Studio 17.0 and earlier, NuGet's package versions are the same as NuGet's product version. For example, if your extension targets Visual Studio 2022 version 17.0, you should use version 6.0 of NuGet's Visual Studio extensibility packages.

## NuGet Client SDK in Visual Studio Extensions

Only the APIs in `NuGet.VisualStudio` and `NuGet.VisualStudio.Contracts` are supported in Visual Studio extensions.
NuGet provides binding redirects for these assemblies, so these assemblies do not need to be included in your extension.

Using NuGet Client SDK packages, for example `NuGet.Protocol`, is not supported in Visual Studio extensions.
NuGet does not provide binding redirects for these assemblies.
See [the NuGet Client SDK support policy](../reference/NuGet-Client-SDK.md#support-policy) for more information.

## Using NuGet Services

> [!Warning]
> Do not use any other types besides the public interfaces in your code, and do not reference any other NuGet assemblies, such as `NuGet.Protocol.dll`, `NuGet.Frameworks.dll`, and so on.

In order to maximize the backwards compatibility promises we make, but also providing ourselves the flexibility to implement new features, performance improvements, and bug fixes in Visual Studio, we do not support the NuGet Client SDK being used in Visual Studio, and we do not provide binding redirects in `devenv.exe.config` to assemblies other than our VS extensibility contracts.

If you would like a new NuGet related API in Visual Studio, please search [NuGet's Home repo](https://github.com/NuGet/Home/) and upvote any existing issues if you find a similar one. If you can't find an existing feature request to upvote, please create one.

### Brokered Services

1. Install the [`NuGet.VisualStudio.Contracts`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NuGet.VisualStudio.Contracts/) package into your project, as well as [`Microsoft.VisualStudio.SDK`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.VisualStudio.SDK).

1. Use the `IAsyncServiceProvider` to get Visual Studio's service broker, and use that to get NuGet's service. Note that [`AsyncPackage` extends `IVsAsyncServiceProvider2`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.visualstudio.shell.asyncpackage), so your class that implements `AsyncPackage` can be used as the `IAsyncServiceProvider`. Also see the docs on [`IBrokeredServiceContainer`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.visualstudio.shell.servicebroker.ibrokeredservicecontainer) and [`IServiceBroker`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.servicehub.framework.iservicebroker)

   ```cs
   // Your AsyncPackage implements IAsyncServiceProvider
   IAsyncServiceProvider asyncServiceProvider = this;
   var brokeredServiceContainer = await asyncServiceProvider.GetServiceAsync<SVsBrokeredServiceContainer, IBrokeredServiceContainer>();
   var serviceBroker = brokeredServiceContainer.GetFullAccessServiceBroker();
   var nugetProjectService = await serviceBroker.GetProxyAsync<INuGetProjectService>(NuGetServices.NuGetProjectServiceV1);
   ```

1. When your code no longer needs NuGet's brokered service, dispose it. For example, if you only need NuGet's brokered service during a single method call, you can wrap it in a C#`using` statement:

   ```cs
   InstalledPackagesResult installedPackagesResult;
   using (nugetProjectService as IDisposable)
   {
       installedPackagesResult = await nugetProjectService.GetInstalledPackages(projectGuid, cancellationToken);
   }
   ```

### MEF Services

1. Install the [`NuGet.VisualStudio`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NuGet.VisualStudio) package into your project, which contains the `NuGet.VisualStudio.dll` assembly.

    In NuGet 5.11 and earlier, the package automatically sets the [**Embed Interop Types**](/dotnet/framework/interop/type-equivalence-and-embedded-interop-types) property of the assembly reference to **True**. [Visual Studio 2022 policy regarding embed interop types changed](/visualstudio/extensibility/migration/migrated-assemblies?view=vs-2022&preserve-view=true), so NuGet.VisualStudio package version 6.0.0 and above no longer use this.

1. To use a service, import it through the [MEF Import attribute](/dotnet/framework/mef/index#imports-and-exports-with-attributes), or through the [IComponentModel service](/dotnet/api/microsoft.visualstudio.componentmodelhost.icomponentmodel).

    ```cs
    //Using the Import attribute
    [Import(typeof(IVsPackageInstaller2))]
    public IVsPackageInstaller2 packageInstaller;
    packageInstaller.InstallLatestPackage(null, currentProject,
        "Newtonsoft.Json", false, false);

    //Using the IComponentModel service
    var componentModel = (IComponentModel)GetService(typeof(SComponentModel));
    IVsPackageInstallerServices installerServices =
        componentModel.GetService<IVsPackageInstallerServices>();

    var installedPackages = installerServices.GetInstalledPackages();
    ```

For reference, the source code for NuGet.VisualStudio is contained within the [NuGet.Clients repository](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/tree/dev/src/NuGet.Clients/NuGet.VisualStudio).

## Understanding the .NET project systems

When SDK style projects were added for .NET Core 1.0, it was designed to be more asynchronous than previous Visual Studio project systems. This has an impact on how all other Visual Studio components interact with it directly, or though other components such as NuGet. This is most noticeable on solution load and project load, where projects are not fully available some time after Visual Studio's older synchronous API notifications have already fired.

During solution load, NuGet ignores `IVsSolutionEvents.OnAfterProjectLoad`, in order to avoid delaying the synchronous part of solution load. NuGet will synchronize its internal data structures after the synchronous part of solution load has completed. This is also true for non-SDK style projects.

Even after all `IVsSolutionEvents.OnAfterSolutionLoad` event handlers finish, this only signals the end of the synchronous part of solution load. The asynchronous part of solution load is still in progress. Therefore, if your extension calls NuGet APIs like `GetInstalledPackagesAsync` or `InstallPackage` soon after project or solution load, NuGet might throw an `InvalidOperationException` with message similar to "The operation failed as details for project {project name} could not be loaded.".

When a solution contains at least one SDK style project, NuGet will automatically perform a restore after solution load, and you should not call any Nuget APIs until this is complete. You can use `IVsNuGetProjectUpdateEvents` to get a notification when the solution restore, or when specific project restores, complete. If a solution does not contain any SDK style projects, then restore will not be scheduled automatically, and may not happen until a build is scheduled.

In order to determine whether a project uses NuGet's asynchronous flow (SDK style project), use [`PackageUtilities.IsCapabilityMatch`](/dotnet/api/microsoft.visualstudio.shell.packageutilities.iscapabilitymatch) with the expression `CPS + PackageReference`.

## IVsPackageManagerProvider interface

This interface was primarily used by the ASP.NET team, to suggest that Javascript and CSS packages like `jQuery` and `bootstrap` are installed with Bower instead of NuGet. Since they removed that functionality From Visual Studio, NuGet has obsolete this interface, and it will no longer be used by the Package Manager UI in Visual Studio 2022 (version 17.0) and later.

```cs

    /// Interface allowing integration of alternate package manager suggestion for a NuGet package.

    /// it might be more appropriate to install a package from them for certain projects.
